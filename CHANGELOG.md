- Created the public GitHub repository, synchronized `main`, and confirmed remote `main` CI.
- Updated GitHub Actions checkout and Node setup actions to v5.
- Added Phase 7 deterministic `review` command for single-URL browser review with local observation, layout, screenshot, report, and mock-metric artifacts.
- Added target-manifest site review with generic route discovery, viewport execution, coverage artifacts, and bounded findings.
- Added machine-readable schema files plus `schema list` and `schema get`.
- Added shell-safe structured input for stdin and `@file` action/target inputs.
- Added local stdio MCP adapter entrypoint `browser-debug-mcp` with an allowlisted tool surface over the same CLI/core contracts.
- Added public local package API exports and excluded internal product documents from the package file set while keeping the package private.
- Strengthened structure, security, architecture, no-browser, and browser smoke checks for review and MCP boundaries.
- Added `target init` for reusable local target manifest generation.
- Added review `action_plan`, local heuristic `review_advisory`, and developer-facing finding enrichment fields.
- Added target review Markdown reports.
- Added MCP target tools for target manifest initialization and target review.
- Added local Codex plugin metadata, plugin MCP configuration, plugin-facing review skill, and a reusable target manifest template.
- Added review `quality_signals` for visual hierarchy, responsive layout, interaction affordance, accessibility structure, evidence completeness, developer handoff, local release readiness, route coverage, and disabled model-review boundaries.
- Expanded local review heuristics for headings, landmarks, image alt text, low contrast text, visible overlap, and mobile touch-target sizing.
- Added Quality Signals sections to Markdown review reports and browser smoke coverage for the new local review-quality signals.
- Added explicit target review execution for manifest `expectedRoutes`.
- Added target coverage output for expected routes and route-budget-exceeded skips.
- Added browser smoke coverage for unlinked expected routes and route budget skip accounting.
- Added optional target manifest `pages` for named page expectations, page-specific viewports, and page-specific mock metrics.
- Added review `evidence_summary`, local `review_artifact_index` artifacts, and `quality_signals.page_expectations`.
- Added browser smoke coverage for manifest page expectations, page-specific mock metrics, review artifact indexes, and page expectation report output.
- Added rendered-state review evidence and findings for broken visible images, lingering loading indicators, and empty data containers without visible empty-state messaging.
- Added rendered-state quality signals, Developer Triage Markdown report summaries, and target manifest suggestions for dogfood reruns.
- Added browser smoke coverage for rendered-state findings, evidence summaries, developer triage reports, and manifest suggestions.
- Refined loading indicator detection so normal ready/progress business-state text is not reported as lingering loading UI unless explicit loading semantics or loading-like attributes are present.
- Added manifest opt-in content UX advisory with bounded inline `sourceData`, page `expectations.dataBindings`, `local_content_ux_advisory`, and `quality_signals.content_ux`.
- Added schema registry/file parity coverage for review and target manifest contracts.
- Added no-browser and browser smoke coverage proving content UX advisory does not change review findings, metrics, existing action plans, or release readiness.
- Added selector-scoped content UX advisory checks for text, explicit attributes, data-state, and data-risk evidence.
- Added required user-question advisory checks for information architecture and user journey review.
- Added a reusable disabled-by-default status-dashboard content UX target manifest template.
- Added separate `content_ux_findings`, `content_ux_action_plan`, and `content_ux_readiness` target-review outputs without changing review findings, metrics, existing action plans, or release readiness.
- Added bounded Content UX Developer Handoff Markdown report output.
- Added expanded content UX advisory categories for status clarity, action clarity, navigation clarity, information architecture, source alignment, content contracts, coverage contracts, and review scope.
- Added separate `content_ux_page_handoff` and `content_ux_manifest_authoring` target-review outputs.
- Added page-level content UX and manifest-authoring summaries to Markdown target reports.
- Added separate `content_ux_review_brief` and `content_ux_rubric_evaluation` target-review outputs for manifest-declared audience, page role, decision-need, and rubric checks.
- Added Content UX Review Brief summaries to Markdown target reports and reusable manifest templates without changing existing review findings, metrics, action plans, or release readiness.
- Replaced the packaged content UX example manifest with a domain-neutral status-dashboard template while preserving selector-scoped state/risk coverage.
- Switched generated/default content UX advisory categories to `status_clarity` and `action_clarity` while keeping legacy rubric category aliases accepted for existing manifests.
- Added `target validate` for no-browser target manifest validation with manifest counts, authoring suggestions, MCP tool coverage, API export, source-value non-disclosure, and local-first boundaries.
- Added `resource status` for no-browser local memory, swap, cgroup, pressure, and process memory preflight with MCP tool coverage, API export, warnings, recommendations, and read-only local-first boundaries.
- Added review `resource_guard` integration with preflight, target route/viewport rechecks, screenshot/trace pressure warnings, and opt-in `fail-critical` stopping before browser launch.
- Added daemon `--idle-timeout` and `--max-lifetime` lifecycle guards with local metadata and worker shutdown behavior.
- Added `resource artifacts plan` and `resource artifacts cleanup --dry-run` for local `.browser-debug/` artifact usage planning without deletion.
- Added explicit `resource artifacts cleanup --execute` scoped to selected regular files under the configured artifact root with local cleanup receipts.
- Added local `agent surfaces list`, `agent package`, `agent ingest`, and `agent report` commands for subscription/local agent handoff and advisory result import without API calls, automatic upload, credential storage, or changes to deterministic review gates.
- Added agent advisory schemas, local package/import receipts, no-browser tests, and architecture boundaries for advisory-only agent output.

## Release Status

No public package has been released. Package naming, license selection, npm authentication, npm publication, plugin marketplace registration, direct model/API execution, evidence leaving the local process, arbitrary source-data file or URL loaders, HTTP/socket MCP server mode, OAuth/login automation, profile reuse, external upload, host memory-cache mutation, swap configuration, cleanup outside the configured artifact root, MCP cleanup execution, privileged helper execution, and arbitrary process control remain explicit release blockers.

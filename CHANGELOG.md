- Added local package dry-run verification with `npm run test:pack`.
- Added `supervise` for one process-scoped ephemeral browser context with ordered actions.
- Added `daemon start`, `daemon status`, and `daemon stop` for local background ephemeral browser supervision.
- Added architecture regressions for generic runtime boundaries, shared page evidence helpers, and local Node CLI packaging.
- Added local GitHub Actions CI configuration and `ops/CI_MANIFEST.tsv` with a product-local CI validation check.

- Created the public GitHub repository, synchronized `main`, and confirmed remote `main` CI.
- Updated GitHub Actions checkout and Node setup actions to v5.
- Added Phase 7 deterministic `review` command for single-URL browser review with local observation, layout, screenshot, report, and mock-metric artifacts.
- Added target-manifest site review with generic route discovery, viewport execution, coverage artifacts, and bounded findings.
- Added machine-readable schema files plus `schema list` and `schema get`.
- Added shell-safe structured input for stdin and `@file` action/target inputs.
- Added local stdio MCP adapter entrypoint `browser-debug-mcp` with an allowlisted tool surface over the same CLI/core contracts.
- Added public local package API exports and excluded internal product documents from the package file set while keeping the package private.
- Strengthened structure, security, architecture, no-browser, and browser smoke checks for review and MCP boundaries.
- Added `target init` for reusable local target manifest generation.
- Added review `action_plan`, local heuristic `review_advisory`, and developer-facing finding enrichment fields.
- Added target review Markdown reports.
- Added MCP target tools for target manifest initialization and target review.
- Added local Codex plugin metadata, plugin MCP configuration, plugin-facing review skill, and a reusable target manifest template.
- Added review `quality_signals` for visual hierarchy, responsive layout, interaction affordance, accessibility structure, evidence completeness, developer handoff, local release readiness, route coverage, and disabled model-review boundaries.
- Expanded local review heuristics for headings, landmarks, image alt text, low contrast text, visible overlap, and mobile touch-target sizing.
- Added Quality Signals sections to Markdown review reports and browser smoke coverage for the new local review-quality signals.
- Added explicit target review execution for manifest `expectedRoutes`.
- Added target coverage output for expected routes and route-budget-exceeded skips.
- Added browser smoke coverage for unlinked expected routes and route budget skip accounting.
- Added optional target manifest `pages` for named page expectations, page-specific viewports, and page-specific mock metrics.
- Added review `evidence_summary`, local `review_artifact_index` artifacts, and `quality_signals.page_expectations`.
- Added browser smoke coverage for manifest page expectations, page-specific mock metrics, review artifact indexes, and page expectation report output.

## Release Status

No public package has been released. Package naming, license selection, npm authentication, npm publication, plugin marketplace registration, model/API review, evidence leaving the local process, HTTP/socket MCP server mode, OAuth/login automation, and external upload remain explicit release blockers.

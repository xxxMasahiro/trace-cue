# Browser Debug CLI

Browser Debug CLI is a planned OSS command-line tool for AI-assisted browser debugging and UI/UX inspection.

The goal is to provide an agent-independent Playwright interface that can observe page state, suggest or execute browser actions, collect evidence, and generate reports without depending on Playwright MCP or any single AI agent runtime.

## Planned Use

- Debug web applications through structured page observations.
- Let an AI or human choose the next browser action from machine-readable candidates.
- Find UI/UX issues, functional defects, broken flows, missing states, and accessibility problems.
- Collect screenshots, traces, and notes for reproducible fixes.
- Use fast headless mode by default, with headed browser and DevTools support for visual quality checks.

## Current Status

This repository has completed the Free Development scaffold, local Git initialization, Phase 2a package/runtime design, and the local MVP runtime slice. The current CLI supports `doctor`, deterministic JSON errors, Playwright-backed one-shot `observe`, local artifacts, session metadata, simple actions, screenshots/traces, reports, and spec export.

## Local CLI

```bash
node ./bin/browser-debug.js doctor --json
node ./bin/browser-debug.js observe --url http://127.0.0.1:5173/ --screenshot --trace --json
npm test
npm run test:browser
```

Artifacts are written under ignored `.browser-debug/` directories. Trace artifacts can contain page content and must remain local. `npm test` runs deterministic no-browser tests; `npm run test:browser` launches local Chromium for smoke coverage.

## Local Checks

GitHub, CI, npm publication, and release automation are planned in later phases.

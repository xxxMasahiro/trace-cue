# Browser Debug CLI

Browser Debug CLI is a planned OSS command-line tool for AI-assisted browser debugging and UI/UX inspection.

The goal is to provide an agent-independent Playwright interface that can observe page state, suggest or execute browser actions, collect evidence, and generate reports without depending on Playwright MCP or any single AI agent runtime.

## Planned Use

- Debug web applications through structured page observations.
- Let an AI or human choose the next browser action from machine-readable candidates.
- Find UI/UX issues, functional defects, broken flows, missing states, and accessibility problems.
- Collect screenshots, traces, and notes for reproducible fixes.
- Use fast headless mode by default, with headed browser and DevTools support for visual quality checks.

## Current Status

This repository currently contains only the Free Development scaffold and initial planning documents. Runtime implementation has not started.

## Canonical Documents

- `docs/product/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `docs/product/SPECIFICATION.md`
- `docs/product/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md`
- `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md`

## Local Checks

```bash
./tools/product-gate
```

Git, GitHub, CI, npm packaging, and release automation are planned in later phases.

# SPECIFICATION.md

## Product Shape

Browser Debug CLI is planned as a Node.js CLI package backed by Playwright. It should be usable from any product repository and should not require the caller to run an MCP server.

The Phase 2a design baseline uses Node.js 20 or newer, ESM modules, and a local CLI binary named `browser-debug`. The final npm package name can still be confirmed during release planning, but runtime code should not depend on a scoped package name.

## Planned Architecture

- CLI entrypoint: accepts commands, options, and JSON input/output flags.
- Core library: owns Playwright session management, observation, actions, and artifact creation.
- Browser supervisor: keeps a reusable browser context alive when fast iterative debugging is needed.
- Observation layer: summarizes URL, title, accessibility tree, visible text, form controls, action candidates, console errors, failed requests, screenshots, and selected metadata.
- Action layer: performs explicit actions such as click, fill, select, press, scroll, wait, navigate, screenshot, and trace capture.
- Report layer: converts session evidence into issue reports and handoff notes.

## Planned CLI Surface

The Phase 2a command surface is:

```text
browser-debug doctor
browser-debug session start
browser-debug session close --session <id>
browser-debug observe --url <url> --json
browser-debug supervise --url <url> --actions <json-array> --json
browser-debug daemon start --url <url> --json
browser-debug daemon status --daemon <id> --json
browser-debug daemon stop --daemon <id> --json
browser-debug act --session <id> --action <json>
browser-debug report --session <id>
browser-debug spec export --session <id>
```

The MVP implementation order is:

1. `doctor` with environment and safety checks.
2. Command parsing and deterministic JSON error output without launching a browser.
3. `observe --url <url> --json` with an ephemeral headless Playwright context.
4. Artifact directory handling under `.browser-debug/`.
5. Session start, explicit actions, reports, and spec export after one-shot observation is stable.

## Current Implemented Slice

The repository now includes a private local Node.js package named `browser-debug-cli` with the `browser-debug` executable at `bin/browser-debug.js`. The implementation is ESM-only and uses Playwright as its browser runtime dependency.

Implemented behavior:

- `browser-debug doctor --json` returns the standard JSON envelope and local environment checks.
- Parser errors return deterministic JSON envelopes when `--json` is used.
- Planned command names are parsed explicitly.
- `observe --url <url> --json` validates absolute `http`, `https`, or `file` URLs, launches an ephemeral Chromium context, captures structured page state, writes a local observation artifact, and closes the context.
- `observe --screenshot` writes a local screenshot artifact.
- `observe --trace` writes a local Playwright trace zip and emits a warning because traces can contain page content.
- `observe --headed` launches a visible browser mode when the host environment supports it.
- `observe --devtools` launches visible browser mode with DevTools enabled when the host environment supports it.
- `supervise --url <url> --actions <json-array>` launches one ephemeral Chromium context, applies ordered local actions in that same process-scoped context, writes observation metadata for the initial page and each action, writes local supervision metadata under `.browser-debug/sessions/`, and closes the context before process exit.
- `daemon start --url <url>` starts a detached local worker process with one ephemeral Chromium context, writes daemon metadata under `.browser-debug/daemons/`, writes an initial observation, and returns a daemon ID and process ID. `daemon status --daemon <id>` reads metadata and checks whether the process is alive. `daemon stop --daemon <id>` sends a local process signal and records the stopped state.
- `session start --url <url>` creates local session metadata and can attach the first observation.
- `act --session <id> --action <json>` supports simple local actions such as `navigate`, `observe`, `screenshot`, `click`, `fill`, `select`, `press`, `scroll`, and `wait` using an ephemeral page visit. Scroll actions use deterministic page scrolling from the requested deltas.
- `report --session <id>` writes a Markdown report.
- `spec export --session <id>` writes a JSON action/spec export.
- `npm test` runs deterministic no-browser tests, including headed/devtools launch-mode regression through an injected Playwright browser type and architecture regressions for generic runtime boundaries, shared page evidence helpers, local daemon boundaries, and local Node CLI packaging. `npm run test:browser` runs Playwright smoke tests for observation, screenshots/traces, click actions, form controls, keyboard input, scroll, wait, reports, spec export, supervised ordered actions, and local daemon start/status/stop.
- `npm run test:pack` runs `npm pack --dry-run --json` with an ignored local npm cache to verify the package file set without publishing.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` defines GitHub Actions jobs for Node.js checks, package dry-run verification, explicit Chromium installation, and browser smoke tests. It uses current GitHub action major versions for checkout and Node setup. `ops/CI_MANIFEST.tsv` and `tools/check_product_ci.sh` validate that definition locally.
- `npm run release:check` runs no-browser and package release-readiness checks without publishing. Browser smoke coverage remains a separate explicit local check because it launches Chromium.
- `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/workflow/RELEASE.md` track unreleased local changes, release blockers, local readiness checks, and no-publish boundaries.

The package is marked `private` and `UNLICENSED` until public release naming, licensing, and npm publication are approved.

## Browser Modes

- `headless`: default fast mode for structured observation and regression debugging.
- `headed`: visible browser mode for final UI/UX quality, animation, hover, focus, and operation feel.
- `devtools`: headed mode with DevTools for targeted inspection.

Long-running browser supervision is opt-in. `supervise` is process-scoped, uses an ephemeral context, does not reuse a user's normal browser profile, and closes before CLI exit. `daemon start` is background-scoped, uses a detached local worker with an ephemeral context, writes only ignored local metadata and observations, and stops through `daemon stop`. The default `observe` path still launches an ephemeral context, collects the requested evidence, and closes cleanly after one page observation.

## AI Interaction Contract

The CLI should expose structured observations and action candidates. The AI decides the next action outside the CLI, then sends that action back to the CLI. This keeps the tool agent-independent and avoids binding the product to one model, one chat UI, or one MCP runtime.

## Artifact Contract

Artifacts should be local by default and written under an ignored product workspace directory such as `.browser-debug/`. Planned artifact types include:

- screenshots
- traces
- console summaries
- network failure summaries
- accessibility summaries
- action history
- issue reports

Sensitive browser data must not be emitted unless a later approved feature defines safe redaction and explicit consent.

The initial artifact layout is:

```text
.browser-debug/
  sessions/
  observations/
  screenshots/
  traces/
  reports/
  specs/
```

Committed files must not include `.browser-debug/`, screenshots, traces, cookies, storage state, existing browser profiles, credentials, or secret-like values.

The default artifact retention policy is manual retention. Browser Debug CLI does not automatically delete generated artifacts, does not upload artifacts, and does not provide a destructive cleanup command in the local MVP. Developers may remove the ignored `.browser-debug/` root themselves after reviewing whether screenshots, traces, reports, or session metadata are still needed. Any future built-in cleanup command must be explicit, local-only, non-secret-bearing, tested, and separately approved because cleanup is destructive.

## JSON Output Contract

Every command that supports `--json` should return an object with these top-level fields:

```text
schema_version
command
status
observed_at
data
warnings
errors
artifacts
```

Errors must be structured and non-secret-bearing. Page content, console output, network data, screenshots, traces, and model suggestions remain untrusted data.

## Schema Versioning Contract

The local MVP schema version is `0.1.0`. This version applies to top-level JSON envelopes, artifact descriptors, local session metadata, daemon metadata, supervision metadata, observation artifacts, and spec exports unless a file declares a more specific artifact schema.

Compatible changes may add fields while keeping existing field names, meanings, and JSON types stable. Breaking changes include renaming fields, removing fields, changing field types, or changing status/error vocabulary semantics; those changes require a schema version bump, synchronized product documents, and regression tests.

`doctor --json` exposes `data.schema_version_policy` and `data.artifact_retention` so agents and scripts can inspect the current compatibility and artifact-retention policy without scraping documents.

## Runtime Security Contract

- Browser contexts are ephemeral by default.
- Existing browser profiles, cookies, storage state, local storage, and credentials are not read or written.
- Artifact root paths must stay inside the current workspace.
- Observation and report data applies basic redaction to common secret-like strings and sensitive URL query parameters.
- Trace zip files are raw local evidence and can contain unredacted page content. They must remain under ignored `.browser-debug/` paths unless a future approved workflow defines safer handling.
- Process-scoped supervision and background daemon supervision both use ephemeral contexts. The background daemon does not create a persistent browser profile, persistent storage state, external control channel, HTTP listener, socket server, or artifact upload path.

## OSS Workflow Contract

The repository should move through these phases:

- Phase 0: scaffold and synchronized planning documents.
- Phase 1: local Git initialization and first commit.
- Phase 2a: package/runtime design without network, dependency installation, or runtime implementation.
- Phase 2b: public GitHub repository creation through `gh`.
- Phase 3: GitHub Actions CI.
- Phase 4: npm package metadata and CLI packaging implementation.
- Phase 5: MVP Playwright implementation.
- Phase 6: release and npm publish flow.

The current repository implements local CI configuration, local CI validation, release readiness documentation, dry-run package verification, public GitHub repository creation, `origin/main` synchronization, and remote GitHub Actions `main` CI verification. It does not execute npm publication or other public release actions.

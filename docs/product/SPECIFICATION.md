## Product Shape

TraceCue is the canonical package, CLI, MCP server, and plugin identity. The legacy Browser Debug CLI name and `browser-debug`/`browser-debug-mcp` bins remain compatibility aliases in this migration slice.

TraceCue is a Node.js CLI package backed by Playwright and local metadata tools. It should be usable from any product repository and should not require the caller to run an MCP server.

The Phase 2a design baseline uses Node.js 20 or newer, ESM modules, and a local CLI binary named `browser-debug`. The final npm package name can still be confirmed during release planning, but runtime code should not depend on a scoped package name.

## Planned Architecture

- CLI entrypoint: accepts commands, options, and JSON input/output flags.
- Core library: owns Playwright session management, observation, actions, and artifact creation.
- Browser supervisor: keeps a reusable browser context alive when fast iterative debugging is needed.
- Observation layer: summarizes URL, title, accessibility tree, visible text, form controls, action candidates, console errors, failed requests, screenshots, and selected metadata.
- Action layer: performs explicit actions such as click, fill, select, press, scroll, wait, navigate, screenshot, and trace capture.
- Report layer: converts session evidence into issue reports and handoff notes.
- Review core: converts normalized browser evidence into deterministic UI review findings.
- Quality signal layer: summarizes local review evidence into visual hierarchy, rendered state, responsive layout, interaction, accessibility, page expectations, evidence completeness, release-readiness, and model-boundary signals.
- Site review layer: discovers routes, runs viewport matrices, applies action risk policy, and emits coverage.
- Artifact index layer: groups local review artifacts, evidence classes, rerun guidance, and local safety boundaries for developer handoff.
- Manifest suggestion layer: turns target review coverage and rendered-state evidence into local suggestions for better reruns without editing runtime code for specific applications.
- Content UX advisory layer: evaluates manifest opt-in source-to-screen content contracts, selector-scoped state contracts, required user-question evidence, review briefs, and rubric criteria from existing target review evidence without creating review findings or changing release gates.
- Resource status layer: reads local process-visible memory, swap, cgroup, and pressure signals before browser-heavy work without launching Playwright, writing artifacts, mutating host cache, changing swap, deleting files, or controlling arbitrary processes.
- Resource guard layer: reuses resource status for review preflight and route/viewport rechecks, emits additive `resource_guard` data, warns on heavy screenshot/trace artifacts, and can stop browser work only when explicitly set to `fail-critical`.
- Resource artifact layer: inventories `.browser-debug/` artifact usage, proposes cleanup candidates, and performs explicit artifact-root-only cleanup with receipts when `--execute` is provided.
- Daemon lifecycle layer: adds optional local idle-timeout and max-lifetime shutdown guards to detached ephemeral browser workers.
- Persistent browser session layer: starts a retained Playwright context and page through local CLI/session metadata, exchanges commands through a local artifact-root file queue, enforces TTL and idle-timeout guards, restricts navigation to an origin allowlist, records value-silent receipts, supports manual-login checkpoints, observes the retained page, hands the current page state to local review artifacts, and shuts down context and browser on stop.
- Agent advisory layer: creates bounded local evidence packages from review artifact indexes, generates handoff prompts for local subscription agents, lists and inspects local request status from package/result artifacts, imports untrusted advisory JSON, and renders separate advisory reports without direct API calls, external upload, credential storage, or deterministic gate changes.
- Agent execution layer: plans and runs subscription-style local agent or API-style provider execution from bounded agent packages through dedicated provider adapters, exposes status/list metadata, and normalizes output as advisory-only results without mutating deterministic review artifacts or existing workflow status semantics.
- Agentic Human Review layer: creates owner-readable plans and metadata packages from existing review artifact indexes for human-like visual, UX, content, comprehension, subjective perception, risk, and improvement review. Execution is CLI-only, requires an exact plan hash plus exact transfer flags, writes `agentic_human_review_advisory` output, blocks generic `agent execution` bypass, and remains excluded from MCP profiles. Schema v2 adds explicit human-review dimensions, provider instruction contracts, review-quality benchmarks, reader-experience review, mechanical-versus-human comparison, human-review coverage, and actionability scoring.
- Agentic Human Review benchmark/calibration layer: provides read-only benchmark case inspection, structured benchmark requirement coverage, fixture-aware calibration diagnostics, direct-vs-TraceCue advisory comparison, batch comparison, reusable human-baseline registry/overlay/draft/approval/claim-readiness diagnostics, owner-labeled human baseline validation/comparison, evidence-set validation and summary, evidence-set regeneration planning, evaluator policy diagnostics, xhigh round planning and simulation, longitudinal quality rollups, claim policy/audit diagnostics, a mechanical claim standard gate, provider capability snapshots, evidence plans, page-type rubric profiles, orchestration diagnostics, owner-baseline requirement contracts, and privacy/disclosure audit metadata without executing providers, writing benchmark artifacts by default, mutating deterministic review artifacts, or changing release gates. Evidence-set and claim-readiness summaries must prove the required benchmark-case by effort matrix explicitly, unwrap supported TraceCue CLI and public API runtime-result artifacts for calibration/comparison/human-baseline inputs, preserve raw advisory-result validation for result entries, classify missing result, mechanical-incomplete, failed-calibration, and missing-comparison blockers separately, report missing `direct-vs-tracecue` comparisons by case, and keep weak calibration coverage as a blocker for any later owner claim review. Advisory normalization exposes `review_claims` only through `claim_integrity`, rejects placeholder or evidence-missing proof claims from strict claim-numerator eligibility, and keeps rejected claims diagnostic. Claim audits classify forbidden-claim policy matches by source, polarity, and gate-blocking status so evidence-backed absence or coverage checks do not become proof-claim blockers while ambiguous or affirmative forbidden text still fails closed. Comparisons expose metric-level regression diagnostics, critical regressed metrics, owner-baseline coverage gaps, and evidence-backed forbidden-claim absence gaps. The claim standard gate consumes the summarized evidence set and optional claim policy, evaluates claim-readiness, longitudinal quality, comparison regressions, owner-baseline matches, xhigh completion, synthetic/local evidence exclusion, and per-result claim audits, exits non-zero when the gate does not pass, emits a read-only minimal rerun plan for unresolved blockers, and still keeps human-equivalent and human-superior claim states false. The evidence-set regeneration planner consumes that gate output and an optional target registry, derives dependency-ordered provider-result repair, calibration, comparison, human-baseline comparison, summary, claim-readiness, longitudinal-quality, and claim-standard-gate command templates, and records that none were executed by the planner. Direct human-baseline comparison may accept a supported validation runtime-result wrapper as the baseline input only by extracting and revalidating the embedded baseline contract. Verified owner-labeled human baselines may be attached to proposals or plans as workspace-confined JSON and converted into path-free plan-hash-bound contracts for provider payloads and later comparison.
- Agentic Human Review staged effort execution layer: `agentic review run --execution-mode staged` is an additive execution strategy for approved `standard`, `deep`, and `xhigh` plans, not a replacement for the default one-shot run. It validates the same plan artifact, supplied plan hash, exact transfer flags, provider/model/surface match, provider capability hash, and live dogfood opt-in before any provider call. Staged execution splits the planned effort roles into bounded provider requests, records normalized non-final stage summaries, then deterministically aggregates them into one final `agentic_human_review_advisory` result. Stage outputs are not accepted by report-quality, calibration, comparison, evidence-set, longitudinal quality, or claim gates as final evidence. The final result keeps the original owner-baseline requirement contract, benchmark coverage contract, model resolution metadata, transfer permissions, and no-raw-response/no-credential boundaries; true multi-call execution is recorded separately from effort completion, and incomplete staged aggregation still remains non-proof, claim-ineligible, and unable to authorize equality, superiority, owner claim-readiness, or release gates.
- Agentic Human Review Responses adapter layer: runs as an optional loopback-only local HTTP adapter that accepts the existing generic provider request contract, validates the local bearer token and disclosure contract, builds a bounded Responses-compatible request with provider-side storage disabled, and returns normalized advisory JSON without storing raw provider responses or credentials. The adapter parses provider output in memory by accepting direct advisory JSON first and, only when needed, extracting exactly one unambiguous provider-authored advisory JSON object from a JSON string, a single JSON Markdown fence, or prose wrapped around one balanced JSON object; malformed JSON guessing, multiple-candidate selection, raw output persistence, and validation bypass are not allowed. When benchmark calibration is enabled, the adapter output contract should ask for exact benchmark coverage records, structured advisory findings, evidence-reference identifiers, and non-placeholder review claims backed by request-catalog evidence or planned role output, then canonicalize safe provider aliases without inventing positive coverage or owner evidence. When an owner-baseline requirement contract is present, the adapter must require one canonical `owner_baseline_findings` record per required owner-label obligation with matching owner label ids, linked criterion ids when present, and evidence references from the request catalog; target-specific criteria without linked owner labels remain fallback obligations. Role-level findings and generic advisory findings may still be normalized into advisory output, but they cannot satisfy the owner-baseline proof contract unless the same proof is present in `owner_baseline_findings`. Normalized advisory results retain `owner_baseline_findings` separately and merge those records into `agentic_human_review_findings` so downstream human-baseline comparison sees the same evidence-backed owner-label surface that adapter validation accepted. Owner-baseline required mentions, required dimensions, and forbidden claims are merged with the benchmark case into an effective coverage contract; provider input and repair context expose compact `required_benchmark_coverage` templates for the full effective contract and compact `required_owner_baseline_coverage` templates for owner-baseline provenance, and post-validation requires matching `benchmark_requirement_coverage` rows with exact strings and catalog-backed evidence references. The provider JSON schema must require the nested benchmark coverage arrays when effective coverage is active and should set `minItems` from the active required coverage contract. Repair context also exposes path-oriented coverage repair targets for missing rows. Forbidden owner-baseline claims are absence checks and must be represented as structured absence rows instead of prose discussion. If a repaired provider response still omits forbidden-claim absence rows, the adapter may complete only those missing absence rows from canonical templates after confirming the provider advisory does not assert the forbidden claim and a catalog evidence id is available; those rows must carry adapter-derived provenance and cannot authorize equality, superiority, release approval, or deterministic gate effects. Owner-baseline and benchmark catalog entries must be prioritized ahead of optional artifact references so bounded catalogs cannot evict required proof identifiers, and provider instructions plus external provider payloads must remain size-bounded by using a compact provider-facing `review_request` view instead of duplicating long owner-baseline arrays, nested provider-instruction owner contracts, plan/package text and visual contracts, owner summaries, or local paths. The original inbound TraceCue request remains the post-validation authority, while the provider-facing view preserves plan hash, effort, roles, xhigh strict-output requirements, effective benchmark requirements, compact owner-baseline criteria, and catalog-backed evidence-reference ids. Generated provider request-size failures may report non-secret section byte counts, but must not store request payloads, raw provider responses, credentials, or local artifact contents. The provider request and repair context must include a compact `required_owner_baseline_findings` contract derived from the approved baseline and evidence catalog, including `owner_label_id`, required owner label ids, linked criterion ids, required fields, and recommended evidence-reference ids. The adapter must not synthesize missing findings from baseline text, role summaries, generic advisory prose, benchmark coverage rows, or coverage patch output. Repair prompts may include redacted missing criterion ids, missing fields, owner label ids, required benchmark coverage templates, required owner-baseline finding templates, required owner-baseline coverage templates, forbidden-claim semantics gaps, coverage repair targets, xhigh missing conditions, invalid review-claim reasons, placeholder role-output stage/role/round metadata, and allowed evidence-reference ids, but repaired output remains subject to the same fail-closed validation. Placeholder role output includes explicit placeholder flags, `reported_by_provider=false`, and role-output summary wording such as a reviewer did not return, role output was not available, or missing output from a role; those records do not count as reported role/round coverage and must be replaced rather than accepted. Ordinary content findings about unavailable page data remain valid provider-authored role output. Forbidden-claim records are absence checks: `present` means the forbidden claim appears in the advisory output, not that the check was covered, and `present=true` combined with absence wording is a semantic contradiction that must be repaired or rejected.
- Agentic Human Review adapter claim-filtering layer: provider-authored `review_claims` are normalized as optional proof candidates. The adapter removes candidates with placeholder text, missing support, unknown role support, or human-equivalent/human-superior wording before returning advisory data, emits bounded `adapter_claim_filtering` diagnostics without claim text, raw provider bodies, credentials, or local paths, and lets TraceCue result normalization carry those diagnostics into `claim_integrity`. The completed advisory run is still usable for report-quality and debugging, but strict claim-numerator eligibility remains false whenever any candidate was rejected. Staged final synthesis may count roles reported in prior normalized stage summaries as support for a retained claim; stage outputs themselves remain non-final evidence.
- Agentic Human Review owner-baseline recovery layer: records whether a candidate advisory result was generated from an owner-baseline requirement contract matching the approved baseline being compared. Human-baseline comparison, evidence-set summaries, claim-standard-gate blockers, and evidence regeneration plans must distinguish ordinary low alignment from a missing or mismatched candidate owner-baseline contract. When the candidate result lacks the matching owner-baseline contract, local comparison regeneration is insufficient; the claim-standard-gate rerun plan must include an approval-required provider result target, and the evidence regeneration planner must resolve that target only from a validated matching owner-contract plan or an explicit target-registry row. Older result plans without a matching owner-baseline requirement contract must remain unresolved rather than being reused silently.
- Visual evidence layer: records browser screenshots, standalone images, mock images, screen captures, window captures, and desktop app captures as metadata-only local evidence with dimensions, hashes, privacy flags, and artifact references but without raw pixel embedding or provider calls.
- Visual review provider policy layer: adds planning-only disclosure metadata to `agent execution plan` records so future AI-assisted visual review provider work starts from explicit no-raw-pixel, no-provider-call, no-MCP-execution boundaries.
- Visual review result preparation layer: turns existing review artifact indexes into metadata-only future visual review result contracts while reading only visual evidence metadata and keeping provider execution disabled.
- Visual review execution layer: runs explicit CLI-only provider adapters from preparation artifacts, sends metadata/local references only, normalizes untrusted advisory output into visual review results, and keeps raw pixels, existing reviews, release gates, and MCP execution unchanged.
- Visual review dashboard layer: aggregates local visual review preparation, execution, and result metadata for CLI, dashboards, and safe MCP clients without writing artifacts, calling providers, reading raw pixels, or changing gates.
- MCP execution gate policy layer: reports required safety gates and current exposure for approved admin-only agent execution plus future MCP write/execute candidates without changing MCP permissions or running providers from the report.
- Operation registry layer: centralizes risky operation families, roadmap group mapping, risk taxonomy, MCP exposure state, approval gates, capability exclusions, and read-only boundaries so capability and gate reports no longer maintain separate operation lists by hand.
- Operation roadmap layer: derives a read-only phase governance report from the operation registry and draft phase memory, exposing A proposal, B implementation-plan, and C local boundary implementation contracts for phases 60-155 without promoting draft entries into formal product-plan commitments or live execution permission.
- Operation contracts layer: derives shared Phase 61-64 contracts for risk taxonomy, gate schema, execute-token shape, and receipt shape from the registry/roadmap foundation without issuing tokens, writing receipts, enabling harnesses, or expanding MCP write/execute authority.
- Operation policy layer: reads repository-local admin policy defaults and reports Phase 65-68 CLI plan readiness, disabled generic harness state, safe MCP readiness, and approved admin-only agent execution exposure without mutating policy, issuing tokens, writing receipts from the report, or running live side effects from the report.
- Operation admin readiness layer: derives Phase 69-70 MCP admin token-flow, generic harness bridge readiness, and approved admin-only agent execution bridge state from policy and registry metadata without issuing or storing tokens, dispatching the generic harness, or expanding MCP write/execute authority beyond agent execution plan/run.
- Operation provider readiness layer: derives Phase 71-78 provider MCP plan, bounded disclosure, env credential guard, approved admin-only fake/local/API execution exposure, and safe MCP status/list readiness from existing provider and MCP profile metadata without reading credential values, calling providers, executing local runners, or transferring evidence from the readiness report.
- Capture planning layer: reports required safety gates for screen, window, and desktop app capture without calling OS capture APIs, writing artifacts, reading pixels, enumerating processes, or changing MCP execution permissions.
- Capture handoff layer: reads an existing workspace image file for metadata and labels it as screen, window, or desktop app evidence without writing artifacts, exposing MCP tools, calling providers, or embedding raw pixels in JSON.
- Desktop review provider-preparation planning layer: reads capture handoff JSON metadata only and reports future review/preparation readiness without rereading image bytes, writing artifacts, exposing MCP tools, calling providers, transferring evidence, or mutating existing reviews.
- Standalone image review layer: reviews workspace-confined image files without launching a browser, embedding raw pixels in JSON, calling providers, uploading evidence, or changing MCP execution exposure.
- Identity audit layer: reads local identity metadata and local Git configuration to report canonical repository URL, legacy repository URL, checkout name, legacy alias, artifact-root migration, and rename-readiness boundaries without mutating Git, contacting remotes, launching browsers, or writing artifacts.
- Language settings layer: reads TraceCue-local dashboard settings, separates dashboard display locale from artifact output language, normalizes the supported 14-locale contract, reports source-language and translation boundaries, and exposes read-only CLI/API/MCP inspection without contacting parent repositories, writing files, launching browsers, or calling providers.
- Schema layer: defines stable JSON contracts for envelopes, artifacts, target manifests, findings, reports, and adapter I/O.
- Adapter layer: keeps CLI as the source of truth and exposes the same core through MCP adapters. Stdio preserves the compatibility profile surface, while explicit HTTP transport is limited to safe-profile loopback requests.
- Consumer usage guide: documents the external-repository connection flow for CLI, MCP stdio, safe HTTP MCP, and Codex plugin users without changing runtime permissions or requiring source inspection. It also documents target runtime readiness so missing consumer API/backend services are interpreted as target-state findings rather than Browser Debug CLI connection failures.

The MVP implementation order is:

1. `doctor` with environment and safety checks.
2. Command parsing and deterministic JSON error output without launching a browser.
3. `observe --url <url> --json` with an ephemeral headless Playwright context.
4. Artifact directory handling under `.browser-debug/`.
5. Session start, explicit actions, reports, and spec export after one-shot observation is stable.

## Current Implemented Slice

The repository now includes a private local Node.js package named `trace-cue` with the canonical `trace-cue` executable at `bin/trace-cue.js` and legacy `browser-debug` aliases. The implementation is ESM-only and uses Playwright as its browser runtime dependency.

Implemented behavior:

- `browser-debug doctor --json` returns the standard JSON envelope and local environment checks.
- Parser errors return deterministic JSON envelopes when `--json` is used.
- Planned command names are parsed explicitly.
- `observe --url <url> --json` validates absolute `http`, `https`, or `file` URLs, launches an ephemeral Chromium context, captures structured page state, writes a local observation artifact, and closes the context.
- `observe --screenshot` writes a local screenshot artifact.
- `observe --trace` writes a local Playwright trace zip and emits a warning because traces can contain page content.
- `observe --headed` launches a visible browser mode when the host environment supports it.
- `observe --devtools` launches visible browser mode with DevTools enabled when the host environment supports it.
- `supervise --url <url> --actions <json-array>` launches one ephemeral Chromium context, applies ordered local actions in that same process-scoped context, writes observation metadata for the initial page and each action, writes local supervision metadata under `.browser-debug/sessions/`, and closes the context before process exit.
- `daemon start --url <url>` starts a detached local worker process with one ephemeral Chromium context, writes daemon metadata under `.browser-debug/daemons/`, writes an initial observation, and returns a daemon ID and process ID. `daemon status --daemon <id>` reads metadata and checks whether the process is alive. `daemon stop --daemon <id>` sends a local process signal and records the stopped state.
- `daemon start --idle-timeout <duration>` and `daemon start --max-lifetime <duration>` add optional lifecycle metadata and local worker timers that stop the daemon after inactivity or a fixed lifetime without external control channels.
- `resource status --json` reports local memory, swap, cgroup, pressure, and current process memory signals. It returns `data.resource_status`, recommendations, local safety boundaries, and warnings for elevated pressure without launching a browser, writing artifacts, mutating system cache, configuring swap, deleting files, uploading evidence, or reusing profiles.
- `resource artifacts plan --json` reports `.browser-debug/` usage, largest files, top-level directory totals, cleanup candidates, and local boundaries without deleting files.
- `resource artifacts cleanup --dry-run --json` reports the same cleanup proposal without deleting files. `resource artifacts cleanup --execute --json` deletes only selected regular files under the configured artifact root, preserves receipts, and writes an `artifact_cleanup_receipt` artifact.
- `agent surfaces list --json` returns provider-neutral local agent surfaces. Local subscription-agent surfaces are available for local handoff; the generic API provider surface is listed as approval-bound and does not execute network requests.
- `agent package --review-index <path> --surface <id> --json` reads an explicitly provided local review artifact index, creates `.browser-debug/agent-packages/<id>/packet.json`, `.browser-debug/agent-packages/<id>/prompt.md`, and an evidence-packet receipt. The package includes bounded triage, coverage, evidence-class, rerun, and local artifact-reference metadata only. It does not copy raw screenshot bytes, trace contents, raw DOM, console payloads, network payloads, reports, or sourceData values.
- `agent requests list --json` scans local `.browser-debug/agent-packages/` and `.browser-debug/agent-results/` metadata and reports whether each advisory package is `waiting_for_agent` or `advisory_imported`. `--package <path>` narrows the status to one workspace-relative package. The command is read-only, does not launch a browser, does not contact providers, does not upload evidence, does not store credentials, does not expose MCP agent execution, and does not mutate review artifacts.
- `agent requests show --package <path> --json` reads one workspace-relative package and returns package metadata, disclosure policy, local artifact-reference summaries, source review index metadata, selected/latest result paths, bounded advisory result summary, and dashboard handoff hints. `--agent-result <path>` can select a specific matching workspace-relative result. The command is read-only, writes no artifacts, does not launch a browser, does not contact providers, does not upload evidence, does not store credentials, does not expose MCP agent execution, and does not mutate review artifacts.
- `agent workflow create --package <path> --json` reads one workspace-relative package, writes `.browser-debug/agent-workflows/<id>/workflow.json` plus a workflow receipt, and records dashboard-oriented package, prompt, agent-review, ingest, report-pending, request status, and provider-boundary metadata. The manifest contains local references and bounded metadata only; it does not copy raw artifact bytes, execute agents, contact providers, upload evidence, store credentials, launch a browser, expose MCP agent execution, or mutate review artifacts.
- `agent workflow status --workflow <path> --json` reads one workspace-relative workflow manifest, recomputes current status from local package/result metadata, and reports `waiting_for_agent`, `advisory_imported`, or `package_missing` with dashboard handoff commands. The command is read-only and writes no artifacts.
- `agent workflow index --json` scans local `.browser-debug/agent-workflows/` manifests and returns aggregate workflow status counts, report-pending counts, and explicit provider boundary flags without writing artifacts, launching a browser, contacting providers, uploading evidence, storing credentials, exposing MCP agent execution, or mutating review artifacts.
- `agent workflow report --workflow <path> --json` reads one workflow status snapshot, writes a bounded Markdown summary under `.browser-debug/reports/`, and keeps deterministic review artifacts unchanged. It does not launch a browser, contact providers, upload evidence, store credentials, expose MCP agent execution, or mutate review artifacts.
- `agentic review propose --brief <request> --json` writes a local non-executing proposal under `.browser-debug/agentic-human-review-proposals/`, translates conversational intent into a review scope, effort mode, role split, and transfer preview, and records that proposal output is not approval for execution or transfer.
- `agentic review plan --review-index <path>|--proposal <path> --json` reads an existing review artifact index or a verified proposal, writes a local Agentic Human Review package, plan, and planning receipt under `.browser-debug/`, explains the review scope in plain language, selects sub-agent roles by effort mode, records transfer permissions, and computes a fresh canonical plan hash without provider execution.
- `agentic review provider-readiness --json` reports provider catalog, environment-variable names, transfer policy, and approval gates without reading credential values, calling providers, transferring evidence, or writing artifacts.
- `agentic review run --plan <path> --plan-hash <sha256> --execute --json` validates the plan contract, stored hash, supplied hash, exact run command, provider/model/surface match, package hash, provider capability hash, exact transfer flags, and live dogfood opt-in when benchmark/dogfood provider-API execution is requested before running a configured agentic review adapter. It writes local execution, approval receipt, run receipt, advisory result, and Markdown report artifacts without storing raw provider responses or credentials, mutating deterministic review output, or exposing MCP execution. The generic API adapter is environment-variable configured, timeout/size bounded, and stores only normalized advisory output. Its optional request timeout override is part of the provider capability contract, so changing it requires a fresh approved plan hash before execution.
- `agentic review run --execution-mode staged` is valid only for approved `standard`, `deep`, and `xhigh` plans. It keeps the default one-shot command compatible while allowing a manually selected staged strategy for long dogfood runs. Each provider stage uses the existing env-only provider path and exact transfer boundary, stores no raw provider response, records only normalized stage metadata, and remains CLI-only. The final advisory is written only after deterministic aggregation under the original plan; incomplete staged output remains advisory and cannot authorize equality, superiority, release gates, or owner claim-readiness.
- `agentic review report-quality --result <path> [--execution <path>] [--evaluator-policy <path>] --json` validates the advisory contract, optionally verifies execution/result pairing, and returns completeness, evidence coverage, verification coverage, human-review coverage, structured benchmark requirement coverage, actionability, evaluator policy warnings, human-review maturity, longitudinal quality evaluation gaps, and warnings with no provider calls, writes, or gate changes. The maturity block records current effort, benchmark case, live-provider dogfood evidence, missing standard/deep/xhigh evidence, missing benchmark cases, comparison/history requirements, and keeps human-equivalent and human-superior claim flags false.
- Agentic Human Review proposal, plan, package, rubric, advisory, and report-quality schemas now include `human_review_schema_version: "2.0.0"` where applicable. Plans include human review, provider instruction, and review benchmark contracts; packages include technical evidence and mechanical review summaries; advisory results include reader experience, mechanical-versus-human comparison, and human-review coverage.
- `agentic review benchmark list|show`, `agentic review calibrate`, `agentic review compare`, `agentic review compare batch`, `agentic review evidence-set validate|summarize|regenerate plan`, `agentic review human-baseline registry|overlay|draft|approval|validate|compare|claim-readiness`, `agentic review evaluator policy`, `agentic review xhigh plan|simulate`, `agentic review quality longitudinal`, `agentic review claim policy|standard-gate|audit`, `agentic review dogfood readiness`, and `agentic review dogfood plan` are read-only calibration and dogfood planning surfaces. They use local benchmark case definitions, reusable rubric/templates, owner-labeled human baseline JSON, approval metadata, evidence-set manifests, supported TraceCue CLI/API runtime-result wrappers, claim-gate rerun plans, optional regeneration target registries, and existing advisory results to report required-mention coverage, required-dimension coverage, owner-label coverage, target-specific must-not-miss coverage, structured evidence-backed record completeness, forbidden-claim detection, role/round coverage, dissent handling, direct-vs-TraceCue mechanical-context gain, actionability, evaluator-policy gaps, batch deltas, longitudinal trends, claim readiness, benchmark-completion readiness, manual live-provider readiness, standard/deep/xhigh dogfood planning, benchmark-case matrix coverage, blocker categories for missing results, mechanical incompleteness, failed calibration, missing calibration cells, missing comparisons, claim-standard-gate pass/fail state, metric-level comparison regressions, claim-integrity failures, minimal rerun targets, evidence-regeneration dependency order, and safety-boundary status. AI baseline drafts are not proof, synthetic or fixture-only approval markers prevent owner-baseline verification, approved baselines require owner approval metadata, target-specific must-not-miss criteria must be linked to evidence-backed owner labels before `owner_labeled` can verify, owner-label coverage is scored from structured findings with local evidence references rather than loose text matches, forbidden-claim absence only scores when absence evidence is backed by local evidence references, and evidence sets report synthetic/local/fake origins separately from real-provider claim-numerator eligibility. The claim standard gate returns a failed command status when owner claim-review readiness does not pass and may emit command templates for minimal reruns; the evidence-set regeneration planner can convert those templates into dependency-ordered command plans, and provider-rerun templates are resolved only after validating an explicit approved-plan registry row or the generic result -> execution -> plan artifact chain, but both commands remain advisory-only and never mutate release gates or run the reruns themselves. These commands do not call providers, read credential values, write artifacts, launch browsers, mutate deterministic review output, or expose MCP tools.
- Agentic Human Review packages include additive `visual_evidence_package_v2`, `visible_text_provenance`, `visible_text_reading_contract`, and `screen_text_understanding_contract` sections. They describe visual references, bounded visible text sources, screen-text review tasks, OCR boundaries, and raw-byte exclusion policy without embedding raw pixel bytes, raw DOM, raw report bodies, credential values, or raw provider responses.
- Agentic Human Review provider payloads apply approved transfer flags to both package-level and plan-level visual/text contracts. When `allow-page-text` is not approved, visible text snippets and provenance sources are replaced with zero-count transfer-safe contracts before a provider API request is built.
- Agentic Human Review results include Quality Evaluator v3, Human Report v3, live dogfood gate metadata, benchmark-completion readiness, and `xhigh_multi_round_review` completion metadata. These fields summarize human likeness, visual specificity, content reading, sensibility, specific fixes, safety boundary, reader story, retained value, lost value, priority fix, missing role/round/critique/synthesis output, and release-gate non-mutation while remaining advisory-only with `gate_effect: none`.
- Agentic Human Review plans, provider requests, adapter output validation, advisory results, report-quality output, xhigh planning/simulation, evidence-set summaries, human-baseline comparisons, claim-readiness diagnostics, and longitudinal quality rollups include an `xhigh` mechanical effort contract. The contract records provider-native effort binding, strict structured-output requirements, placeholder rejection, required role/round coverage, synthesis integration, structured benchmark records with local evidence-reference identifiers, repair-readiness metadata, multi-step execution readiness, and strict claim-numerator eligibility. A provider may still choose how to reason internally, but TraceCue counts `xhigh` proof-readiness only when these observable contract fields are satisfied.
- `npm run ahr:responses-adapter -- --json` starts the optional Agentic Human Review Responses adapter. It binds to a loopback host only, accepts exactly one configured path, requires the adapter bearer token from the configured environment variable, reads the upstream provider credential from a separate provider-key environment variable or fallback provider-key environment variable, rejects raw pixel bytes and local path disclosure, builds a Responses request with `store: false`, no provider tools, bounded JSON schema output, validates benchmark output, structured findings, owner-baseline coverage, and optional review claims against the request evidence-reference catalog and planned role contract, and returns normalized advisory JSON only. The adapter may recover from provider formatting wrappers by extracting one clear advisory JSON object from memory, but it rejects malformed, multiple, non-JSON-fenced, array, primitive, or non-advisory outputs without storing raw text. Invalid review claims are repairable only through bounded redacted retry context and are rejected again if they remain placeholder, unsupported, or evidence-missing. The adapter does not store raw provider responses, does not record credential values, does not mutate deterministic findings or release gates, and is not exposed through MCP.
- `agentic review status --execution <path> --json` and `agentic review list --json` read local Agentic Human Review execution metadata only. Generic `agent execution plan/run` rejects Agentic Human Review proposals and packages so this owner-layer contract cannot be bypassed through the older execution surface.
- `agent ingest --package <path> --input <json> --json` validates and normalizes untrusted agent output from inline JSON, stdin, or a workspace-relative `@file` into `agent_advisory`, `agent_advisory_findings`, `agent_advisory_action_plan`, `agent_advisory_readiness`, and `owner_decision_requests`. These outputs are separate from review `findings`, `metrics.finding_count`, existing `action_plan`, and `quality_signals.release_readiness`.
- `agent report --review-index <path> --agent-result <path> --json` writes a separate Markdown advisory report under `.browser-debug/reports/` without mutating existing review artifacts.
- `session start --url <url>` without persistent-session options preserves the legacy local metadata behavior and can attach the first observation.
- `session start --url <url> --ttl <duration> [--idle-timeout <duration>] [--origin-allowlist <origin-list>]` starts an opt-in persistent browser session backed by one retained Playwright context and page. Persistent session startup records metadata and receipts under the configured artifact root, enforces TTL and idle-timeout guards, and restricts navigation to the supplied or seed-derived origin allowlist.
- `session start --url <login-url> --headed --manual-checkpoint <name> --ttl <duration>` opens a headed persistent session for manual login handoff. TraceCue does not enter passwords, automate OAuth, or bypass authentication. Completion is recorded later by checkpoint conditions.
- `session start --storage-state <artifact-auth-json>` imports Playwright storageState only when the file resolves under the configured artifact auth directory. StorageState import is explicit, local, value-silent, and never a default.
- `session status --session <id>`, `session stop --session <id>`, `session act --session <id> --action <json>`, `session observe --session <id>`, `session checkpoint --session <id>`, and `session review --session <id>` operate on a persistent session without replacing the legacy `session close`, `act`, `report`, or `spec export` behavior.
- `act --session <id> --action <json>` supports simple local actions such as `navigate`, `observe`, `screenshot`, `click`, `fill`, `select`, `press`, `scroll`, and `wait`. Legacy metadata sessions use the existing ephemeral page visit path, while persistent sessions run actions against the retained page. Fill values are needed for execution but are not printed in outputs, specs, receipts, or action history.
- `session observe --session <id> [--screenshot]` observes the retained page and can write local screenshot evidence without destroying the session.
- `session checkpoint --session <id> --name <name> [--until-url <pattern>] [--until-selector <selector>] [--export-storage-state]` records manual-login or other handoff evidence from the retained page. Completion checks are bounded by timeout and record URL, timestamp, redacted summary, observation artifacts, and optional value-silent storageState export metadata.
- `session review --session <id> [--screenshot] [--report]` builds a local review handoff artifact index from the current retained page state without changing `review --url` behavior.
- `report --session <id>` writes a Markdown report.
- `spec export --session <id>` writes a JSON action/spec export.
- `review --url <url>` runs a single-URL deterministic local review, captures observation and layout evidence, optionally captures screenshots and mock metrics, writes review artifacts, and returns evidence-backed findings.
- `review --target <manifest>` runs a manifest-driven site review with generic route discovery, explicit expected-route execution, optional page expectation checks, viewport matrix execution, coverage artifacts, local review artifact indexes, and aggregated findings.
- `review --resource-guard advisory|fail-critical|off` controls additive local resource guard behavior. Advisory is the default. Fail-critical can stop before browser launch or skip remaining target work only when resource status is critical. Resource guard output does not change review findings, `metrics.finding_count`, existing `action_plan`, or `quality_signals.release_readiness`.
- `target init --url <url>` writes a reusable local target manifest artifact under `.browser-debug/targets/` with same-origin scope, seed route, empty expected route and page lists, viewport matrix, route budget, screenshot defaults, and safe local review boundaries.
- `target validate --target <manifest>` or `target validate --input -` loads a target manifest through the same normalization contract as target review, returns route/page/content UX counts, manifest-authoring suggestions, review next commands, and explicit local-first boundaries, and does not launch a browser, mutate the manifest, expose sourceData values, upload artifacts, or reuse profiles.
- Review results include `action_plan`, `review_advisory`, `quality_signals`, `evidence_summary`, and `artifact_index` objects. Target review results also include `manifest_suggestions`, and can include `local_content_ux_advisory`, `content_ux_findings`, `content_ux_action_plan`, `content_ux_readiness`, `content_ux_page_handoff`, `content_ux_manifest_authoring`, `content_ux_review_brief`, and `content_ux_rubric_evaluation` only when the target manifest explicitly enables it. `action_plan` prioritizes review findings, groups developer next actions, and reports a local release gate. Content UX action/readiness/page/authoring/brief/rubric output is separate and advisory-only. `review_advisory` is a local heuristic signal that summarizes browser health, rendered state, layout, accessibility, interaction, mock, and coverage concerns without claiming human or model aesthetic approval. `quality_signals` gives structured developer handoff data for visual hierarchy, rendered state, responsive layout, interaction affordance, accessibility structure, evidence completeness, local release readiness, route coverage, page expectations, optional content UX advisory, and the disabled model-review boundary. `artifact_index` points to a local artifact index JSON that groups evidence classes and rerun guidance.
- `schema list` and `schema get --name <schema>` expose machine-readable JSON contracts for envelopes, artifacts, findings, target manifests, review results, and MCP tool metadata.
- `browser-debug-mcp` provides a local stdio MCP adapter with an allowlisted tool surface over the same CLI/core contracts, including target manifest initialization, target manifest validation, local resource status preflight, local artifact usage planning, target review, and read-only local agent advisory/status inspection. It does not expose artifact cleanup execution, write-producing advisory commands, or agent execution run.
- `browser-debug-mcp --profile safe|full|admin` selects the MCP tool surface at launch. No-profile `browser-debug-mcp` and the packaged `.mcp.json` resolve to `full` for compatibility with the existing adapter. `safe` exposes no-browser/no-delete/no-provider tools only, including local agent surfaces, request status/detail, workflow status/index, and execution status/list. `full` may expose bounded process-scoped `browser_debug_supervise` but does not expose persistent sessions. `admin` is explicit and exposes only the approved stdio `agent execution plan/run` bridge and approved stdio persistent session tools beyond `full`; it does not expose cleanup execution, Agentic Human Review, unrelated provider/API execution, safe/full/HTTP persistent session control, shell, socket listeners, HTTP `full` or `admin`, external upload, provider credentials, existing-browser-profile reuse, or arbitrary process control.
- `browser-debug-mcp --transport http --profile safe --host 127.0.0.1 --port <port>` starts an explicit safe HTTP MCP endpoint. It binds only to loopback hosts, requires a bearer token from `BROWSER_DEBUG_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` by default, validates loopback Host and Origin headers, limits request bodies, accepts one JSON-RPC object per POST, and uses the same safe-profile allowlist as stdio. It does not expose `full` or `admin` over HTTP.
- `browser-debug mcp config --json` emits reusable stdio MCP client configuration without launching a server, writing files, or reading credentials. Generated client config defaults to the `safe` profile; the packaged `.mcp.json` remains compatibility `full`; generated `local_checkout` metadata contains the current checkout's `node` launch command and absolute MCP entrypoint for unpublished local use.
- `browser-debug mcp config --transport http --profile safe --port <port> --json` emits token-free launch and client-connection metadata for the explicit safe HTTP MCP endpoint, including the URL, token environment variable name, authorization header placeholder, protocol version, body limit, safe-profile boundaries, and a `local_checkout.launch` alternative for unpublished local use.
- `browser-debug mcp capabilities --json` emits a read-only MCP capability policy report with profile tool surfaces, transport support, the current admin policy, explicit excluded operations, and boundary flags. It does not launch a server, write files, read token values, store credentials, or enable write/execute operations.
- `trace-cue operation registry --json` emits the shared read-only operation registry with roadmap groups, risk taxonomy, current MCP exposure flags, required gates, capability exclusion metadata, and boundary flags. It is the source for risky operation metadata used by `mcp capabilities` and `mcp execution gates`; registry presence does not authorize execution.
- `trace-cue operation roadmap --json` emits read-only draft phase A/B/C boundary contracts with phase, group, risk, sequence, related registry operations, approval-bound status, and no-live-execution boundary flags. It does not promote Phase 61-155 into product-plan commitments or authorize execution.
- `trace-cue operation contracts --json` emits the shared read-only Phase 61-64 operation contracts for risk taxonomy, plan/execute/receipt gate shapes, execute-token fields, receipt fields, selected registry operations, and no-live-execution boundary flags. It does not issue tokens, write receipts, enable a harness, or authorize execution.
- `trace-cue operation policy --json` emits the read-only Phase 65-68 operation policy and readiness report with admin policy defaults, selected registry operation context, contract references, CLI plan readiness, disabled harness state, safe MCP readiness, and no-live-execution boundary flags. It does not change policy config, issue tokens, write receipts, enable a harness, or authorize execution.
- `trace-cue operation admin-readiness --json` emits the read-only Phase 69-70 MCP admin readiness report with execute-token flow prerequisites, harness bridge prerequisites, selected registry operation context, admin policy requirements, approved agent execution bridge state, approval boundary flags, and no-live-execution boundary flags. It does not issue tokens, store tokens, expand MCP admin execution beyond the approved agent execution bridge, dispatch a generic harness, or authorize execution from the readiness report.
- `trace-cue operation provider-readiness --json` emits the read-only provider readiness report with Phase 71-78 provider MCP plan readiness, disclosure contract defaults, env credential guard names, approved admin-only fake/local/API execution exposure, safe MCP status/list contract metadata, selected registry operation context, and no-provider-call boundary flags for the report itself. It accepts registry operation ids and canonicalizes capability-id aliases such as provider API execution to the registry operation id. It does not read credential values, call providers, execute local runners, or transfer evidence from the readiness report.
- `trace-cue mcp execution gates --json` now derives operation entries from the shared operation registry while preserving read-only behavior and current MCP write/execute exclusion.
- `trace-cue settings show --json` and `trace-cue settings language --json` read `ops/DASHBOARD_SETTINGS.json` when present and otherwise return defaults. They keep dashboard display locale and artifact output language independent, normalize locale aliases, expose text direction and `Intl` locale metadata, and report translation execution as disabled.
- `trace-cue settings language policy --json` returns the supported 14-locale contract, separate `dashboard_display` and `artifact_output` roles, source/UI/explicit output modes, reserved translation modes, and local read-only boundary flags. It writes no files, launches no browser, calls no providers, reads no credentials, and does not contact the parent lesson repository.
- Review and visual review dashboard outputs include bounded `language_settings` metadata. The metadata does not translate source evidence, raw page text, selectors, URLs, logs, screenshots, traces, or report bodies, and it does not change deterministic findings, `metrics.finding_count`, existing action plans, quality signals, release readiness, artifact cleanup, or gates.
- `docs/workflow/CONSUMER_USAGE.md` is a packaged external-repository usage guide. It explains how to run the CLI from a consumer repository, how to generate MCP stdio and safe HTTP MCP setup metadata, how to treat the Codex plugin as a discovery wrapper, how to keep consumer target manifests and raw `.browser-debug/` artifacts local, and how to document target runtime/API prerequisites in the consumer repository.
- MCP profile selection happens at server launch or trusted adapter context, not per MCP request. `tools/list` and `tools/call` fail closed for invalid profiles or out-of-profile tool names.
- MCP `@file` structured input is workspace-confined. Absolute paths, parent traversal, symlink escapes, non-regular files, and oversized files are rejected for MCP requests. Normal CLI `@file` behavior is unchanged outside MCP-restricted contexts.
- Product identity metadata is explicit and reusable. The current package name, CLI bin name, MCP bin name, MCP server name, plugin name, display name, repository URL, and packaged skill path remain unchanged, but tests, package dry-run checks, and packed-install smoke derive expectations from the identity contract so a future approved rename can be implemented predictably.
- Browser screenshot capture now writes additive `visual_evidence` metadata records next to existing screenshot artifacts. The metadata includes dimensions, hashes, source kind, privacy flags, and local artifact references only.
- `agent execution plan` records now include `visual_review_provider_policy` planning metadata. This policy is not an execution path, never embeds raw pixels, never calls providers, never authorizes external evidence transfer, and remains excluded from MCP execution surfaces.
- `visual review prepare --review-index <path>` reads an existing local review artifact index and referenced visual evidence metadata, then writes `.browser-debug/visual-review-results/<id>/preparation.json` plus a receipt. The command produces a future `visual_review_result` template and disclosure contract without reading raw screenshot/image bytes, calling providers, transferring evidence, exposing MCP execution, or mutating existing review artifacts.
- `act --input -`, `supervise --input -`, `--action @file`, and `--actions @file` support shell-safe structured input while preserving inline JSON compatibility.
- `npm test` runs deterministic no-browser tests, including headed/devtools launch-mode regression through an injected Playwright browser type and architecture regressions for generic runtime boundaries, shared page evidence helpers, local daemon boundaries, and local Node CLI packaging. `npm run test:browser` runs Playwright smoke tests for observation, screenshots/traces, click actions, form controls, keyboard input, scroll, wait, reports, spec export, supervised ordered actions, and local daemon start/status/stop.
- `npm run test:pack` runs `npm pack --dry-run --json` with an identity-derived `/tmp` npm cache path to verify the package file set without publishing.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` defines GitHub Actions jobs for Node.js checks, package dry-run verification, explicit Chromium installation, and browser smoke tests. It uses current GitHub action major versions for checkout and Node setup. `ops/CI_MANIFEST.tsv` and `tools/check_product_ci.sh` validate that definition locally.
- `npm run release:check` runs no-browser and package release-readiness checks without publishing. Browser smoke coverage remains a separate explicit local check because it launches Chromium.
- `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/workflow/RELEASE.md` track unreleased local changes, release blockers, local readiness checks, and no-publish boundaries.

The package is marked `private` and `UNLICENSED` until public release naming, licensing, and npm publication are approved.

## Implemented Review Platform

The review platform is implemented as a reusable layer above the current Playwright runtime. It does not reimplement Playwright and does not clone the full Playwright MCP tool surface. It collects local browser evidence, normalizes that evidence, and emits developer-facing findings with explicit evidence and confidence.

Implemented review components:

- `playwright-runtime`: shared browser, context, page, action, screenshot, and trace execution.
- `evidence-model`: normalized DOM, accessibility, bounding box, computed style, console, network, viewport, and artifact evidence.
- `review-engine`: deterministic and bounded heuristic rules for browser health, rendered state, layout integrity, interaction quality, accessibility basics, mock fidelity, evidence quality, heading hierarchy, landmarks, image alt text, broken visible images, explicit or semantically marked lingering loading indicators, empty data containers, contrast, overlap, and mobile target sizing.
- `site-review`: target manifest loading, route discovery, viewport matrix execution, action risk policy, budgets, and coverage reporting.
- `reporter`: JSON and Markdown issue reports with artifact references, reproduction steps, prioritized action plans, developer triage summaries, manifest suggestions, local artifact indexes, local heuristic advisory data, and implementation-focused fix candidates.
- `content-ux-advisory`: pure local helper that reads normalized manifest data and target review summaries, then returns advisory source-to-screen, selector-scoped state, and user-question signals without Playwright, filesystem access, or artifact reads.
- `resource-status`: pure local preflight helper that reads process-visible memory, swap, cgroup, and pressure state without Playwright, shell execution, host mutation, artifact writes, or external transfer.
- `resource-guard`: reusable review guard that classifies local resource pressure before browser work and before each target route/viewport review.
- `resource-artifacts`: local artifact usage and explicit cleanup helper scoped to the configured artifact root with dry-run and receipt behavior.
- `schema`: machine-readable contracts for envelopes, findings, artifacts, target manifests, reports, and MCP tool I/O.
- `cli-adapter`: the primary command surface for review workflows.
- `mcp-adapter`: thin local MCP adapters over the same core through `browser-debug-mcp`; stdio remains the compatibility default, and HTTP is explicit, loopback-only, token-gated, and safe-profile-only.

The review MVP supports:

```text
browser-debug review --url <url> --viewport <name-or-size> --screenshot --json
```

It should produce the standard JSON envelope with `data.review`, `data.findings`, `data.metrics`, `data.action_plan`, `data.review_advisory`, `data.quality_signals`, additive `data.resource_guard`, and `data.environment`, plus artifact descriptors. Findings should include:

```text
id
category
severity
confidence
source
selector
rect
route
viewport
message
evidence
artifacts
repro
priority
impact
recommendation
fix_candidates
implementation_notes
owner_decision_required
```

The initial deterministic categories are:

- `browser_health`: console errors, page errors, failed requests, navigation failures, broken visible images, and timeout warnings.
- `layout_integrity`: empty render, horizontal overflow, clipped text, explicit lingering loading indicators, empty data containers without empty-state messaging, overlapping visible elements, zero-size important elements, and off-viewport primary controls.
- `interaction_quality`: actionability, focus visibility, hover/focus evidence, target size, mobile touch-target sizing, disabled state, and basic keyboard path signals.
- `accessibility_basics`: missing accessible names, unlabeled form controls, duplicate IDs, heading hierarchy issues, missing main landmarks, missing image alt text, low text contrast, and basic ARIA/name issues.
- `mock_fidelity`: optional screenshot-to-mock metrics, masked regions, and conservative inconclusive states.
- `evidence_quality`: missing screenshots, unstable captures, missing environment metadata, and review limitations.

The site review command supports a generic target manifest:

```text
browser-debug review --target <manifest> --json
```

The target manifest should describe:

```text
baseUrl
scope
seeds
expectedRoutes
pages
sourceData
localContentUxAdvisory
viewportMatrix
actionPolicy
budgets
artifacts
masks
regions
appHints
```

The runtime must not contain product-specific branches for individual applications, localhost ports, route names, menu labels, or page IDs. Those targets can be represented as local manifests, fixtures, or acceptance evidence outside the generic review runtime.

Route discovery is generic and uses same-origin anchors and navigation action candidates in the current implementation. Manifest `expectedRoutes` are also enqueued as explicit review targets, so owners can cover known routes that are not discoverable from the initial crawl. Optional manifest `pages` are also enqueued as review targets and can define `name`, `url` or `path`, `priority`, `viewports`, `expectations.text`, `expectations.selectors`, `expectations.dataBindings`, and optional page-level `mock` metrics. Coverage output reports expected, discovered, visited, skipped, failed, expected-missing routes, and page expectation checks. Queued routes or pages that cannot be reviewed because `budgets.maxRoutes` is exhausted are recorded as skipped with `reason=route_budget_exceeded`. Later enhancements may add history navigation, DOM metadata, redirects, and app-provided manifest hints without changing the core contract.

`target init` exists so a developer or agent can create a starting manifest before reviewing a whole application. The generated manifest is intentionally generic: it does not include application-specific route names or control labels, and it expects owners to add known `expectedRoutes`, `pages`, route budgets, viewport matrices, masks, or regions as needed. `target validate` exists as a no-browser authoring checkpoint after those edits. It reports normalized manifest counts and advisory authoring gaps without reading arbitrary source-data files or URLs, exposing sourceData values, launching Chromium, or writing changes back to the manifest. After editing, `expectedRoutes` and `pages` are review inputs, not just passive coverage expectations.

Action exploration should be risk-gated. The default policy may execute navigation and read-only state-revealing actions. Input-required, mutating, destructive, and external actions require explicit manifest allowlists and must remain local-first.

Mock comparison is optional. The current local implementation compares PNG dimensions, hashes, and byte-difference metrics without adding image-processing dependencies. If actual and mock dimensions differ, the result is `inconclusive` rather than a false pass/fail claim. Pixel heatmaps and region crops remain later compatible enhancements.

## Local Quality Signals Contract

`quality_signals` is an additive review output object. It is designed for developer triage and agent handoff, not final product approval. Single-URL review includes:

```text
visual_hierarchy
rendered_state
responsive_layout
interaction_affordance
accessibility_structure
evidence_completeness
developer_handoff
release_readiness
model_review_boundary
```

Target-manifest review includes:

```text
route_coverage
page_expectations
content_ux
viewport_coverage
rendered_state
finding_summary
evidence_completeness
developer_handoff
release_readiness
model_review_boundary
```

The `model_review_boundary` signal must remain `not_enabled` with `external_evidence_transfer=false` until a separately approved model or vision review layer exists. Local release readiness is a review gate over the current evidence only; it does not authorize package publication, license changes, marketplace registration, npm publication, or evidence upload.

For target reviews, `quality_signals.route_coverage` includes expected manifest route counts, visited route-viewport counts, skipped route counts, and route-budget-exceeded counts so agents can decide whether to raise the route budget, split a manifest, or rerun the review. `quality_signals.page_expectations` includes expected page counts, checked pages, failed pages, skipped pages, missing text expectations, and missing selector expectations so agents can identify page-state mismatches before human or model approval. `quality_signals.content_ux` is present only for manifest opt-in advisory runs and summarizes source-to-screen, selector-scoped binding, and required user-question advisory counts without affecting release readiness. `quality_signals.rendered_state` summarizes broken-image, loading-indicator, and empty-container findings across visited route viewports.

`manifest_suggestions` is an additive target-review output. It suggests manifest-only improvements such as adding named page expectations, pinning important expected routes, raising or splitting exhausted route budgets, reviewing failed page expectations, and adding fixtures or page expectations for rendered-state gaps. Suggestions are advisory and never mutate manifest files automatically.

## Local Content UX Advisory Contract

`local_content_ux_advisory` is an additive target-review output. It is emitted only when a target manifest declares `localContentUxAdvisory.enabled=true`. Absent or disabled configuration keeps target review output compatible with previous behavior.

The manifest contract is:

```text
sourceData
localContentUxAdvisory.enabled
localContentUxAdvisory.audience
localContentUxAdvisory.goal
localContentUxAdvisory.checks
localContentUxAdvisory.requiredUserQuestions[]
localContentUxAdvisory.reviewBrief
localContentUxAdvisory.rubric[]
pages[].role
pages[].expectations.dataBindings[]
pages[].expectations.userQuestions[]
```

`sourceData` supports bounded inline JSON entries with `id`, `data`, optional `required`, and optional `maxSizeBytes`. The local implementation does not read arbitrary manifest paths or remote source URLs. If a source entry declares a `path` or `url`, the advisory records that the external reference was ignored and asks the owner to provide bounded inline data or approve a future loader design.

Each `dataBindings` entry can declare `id`, `sourceId`, JSON Pointer `pointer`, optional `selector`, `target`, `attribute`, `match`, `severity`, and `required`. `target="text"` checks either reviewed page text or selector-scoped element text when `selector` is provided. `target="attribute"` requires a selector and an attribute name from the bounded element-evidence allowlist. `target="data-state"` checks selector-scoped state attributes such as `data-state`, `data-status`, `aria-current`, `aria-selected`, `aria-expanded`, or `aria-pressed`. `target="data-risk"` checks selector-scoped risk attributes such as `data-risk`, `data-severity`, `aria-invalid`, or `aria-disabled`.

`requiredUserQuestions` and page-level `userQuestions` can declare `id`, `question`, optional `pageId`, optional `selector`, `expectedEvidence`, `matchMode`, `textMatch`, `severity`, and `required`. The advisory checks whether the reviewed page text or selector-scoped element text contains enough evidence for the target user to answer the declared question. This is a local heuristic information-architecture signal, not subjective product approval.

`reviewBrief` can declare `summary`, `userRoles`, and `decisionNeeds[]`. `rubric[]` can declare `id`, `category`, optional `pageId`, optional `selector`, `criterion`, `expectedEvidence`, `matchMode`, `textMatch`, `severity`, and `required`. Manifest pages can declare a generic `role` such as `status_overview`, `triage_detail`, or `decision_gate`. The local advisory evaluates decision needs and rubric criteria against reviewed page text or selector-scoped element text, but it does not copy expected evidence values or source values into report output.

The output includes status, counts, advisory signals, separate `content_ux_findings`, separate `content_ux_action_plan`, separate `content_ux_readiness`, separate `content_ux_page_handoff`, separate `content_ux_manifest_authoring`, separate `content_ux_review_brief`, separate `content_ux_rubric_evaluation`, source-data availability counts, user-question counts, limitations, and `quality_signals.content_ux`. It does not copy source values, full page text, raw DOM, screenshots, console payloads, or network payloads into the advisory output or Markdown report. It is advisory-only: it must not create review findings, change `metrics.finding_count`, change the existing `action_plan`, change `quality_signals.release_readiness`, or authorize external evidence transfer.

`content_ux_findings` are not entries in the existing `findings` array and do not use the review finding schema. They are bounded developer-handoff records derived from local advisory signals with category, severity, confidence, source signal, selector/page context, sanitized evidence summary, recommendation, and `gate_effect="none"`. `content_ux_action_plan` groups those advisory records into content-owner next actions and sets `legacy_action_plan_unchanged=true`. `content_ux_readiness` summarizes advisory-only readiness and sets `legacy_release_readiness_unchanged=true`, `blocking_release_gate=false`, and `external_evidence_transfer=false`.

`content_ux_findings.category` can include `content_contract`, `source_data_alignment`, `status_clarity`, `information_architecture`, `action_clarity`, `navigation_clarity`, `coverage_contract`, or `review_scope`. Existing manifests that declare `workflow_state_clarity` or `next_action_clarity` as rubric categories remain accepted as legacy-compatible aliases, but generated templates and default advisory findings use the domain-neutral category names. `content_ux_page_handoff` groups advisory findings by manifest page, including page status, finding count, top categories, and bounded top findings. `content_ux_manifest_authoring` suggests manifest-only improvements such as declaring audience or goal, adding inline source data, adding page data bindings, adding user questions, fixing binding pointers, or strengthening action and navigation contracts. These suggestions are advisory and never mutate the manifest automatically.

`content_ux_review_brief` summarizes declared audience, page roles, and decision needs. `content_ux_rubric_evaluation` summarizes rubric criteria by category and records passed, owner-review, and inconclusive criteria. Both are local, advisory-only, additive, and separate from review findings and release readiness.

## Local Artifact Index Contract

Each review writes a local `review_artifact_index` JSON artifact under `.browser-debug/review-artifacts/`. The index records the review ID, review mode, artifact root, artifact descriptors, evidence classes, triage summary, coverage summary when available, rerun guidance, and local safety boundaries. The index is a handoff aid only; it does not upload evidence, delete artifacts, reuse browser profiles, store credentials, or authorize publication.

## Local Resource Status Contract

`resource status` is a no-browser preflight command for planning browser-heavy work. It reads process-visible system memory, swap, cgroup memory limits, Linux memory pressure data when available, and current Node.js process memory. The standard JSON envelope includes `data.resource_status.status`, memory snapshots, cgroup snapshots, pressure snapshots, process memory, thresholds, recommendations, a `cache_policy`, and explicit local boundaries.

The command status reflects successful inspection, while `data.resource_status.status` can be `ok`, `watch`, or `critical`. `watch` and `critical` produce warnings and recommendations such as reducing route or viewport budgets, splitting manifests, validating target manifests before browser review, capturing screenshots and traces selectively, and stopping unneeded Browser Debug CLI daemons. These are planning signals, not deterministic product gates.

The command must not launch a browser, write artifacts, upload evidence, reuse browser profiles, mutate system cache, change swap configuration, delete files, execute shell commands, run privileged helpers, or control arbitrary processes. Any future host cleanup, swap configuration, cleanup outside the configured artifact root, or privileged memory operation requires a separate approved design, security documentation, tests, and operator approval.

## Local Resource Guard and Artifact Safety Contract

`review --resource-guard advisory|fail-critical|off` reuses the local resource status contract. It records preflight checks before single-URL review and route/viewport checks during target review. Advisory is the default and emits warnings only. Fail-critical can stop browser launch or skip remaining target work only when the resource status is critical. The output is additive under `data.resource_guard` and must not change review findings, `metrics.finding_count`, existing `action_plan`, or `quality_signals.release_readiness`.

`resource artifacts plan` inventories the configured artifact root and returns summary totals, top-level directory totals, largest files, cleanup candidates, and no-delete boundaries. `resource artifacts cleanup --dry-run` returns the same proposal without deleting files. `resource artifacts cleanup --execute` deletes selected regular files only under the configured artifact root and writes a local receipt under `receipts/`. It does not follow symlinks, mutate system cache, configure swap, execute shell commands, use privileged helpers, upload evidence, reuse profiles, control arbitrary processes, or expose cleanup execution through MCP.

## Agent Advisory Handoff Contract

The agent advisory layer is a local handoff/import contract for subscription-capable local agents and a future API-provider boundary. It is not direct model/API execution and is not a deterministic review gate.

The surface registry uses provider-neutral records:

```text
id
kind: subscription_surface | api_provider
transport: local_files | local_stdio | provider_api
status: available | approval_required | disabled
external_evidence_transfer
credential_mode
implemented
capabilities
boundaries
```

`local-subscription-agent` and `local-stdio-agent` are available local surfaces. `generic-api-provider` is an approval-bound boundary marker only; it does not contact a provider, require credentials, upload evidence, or send artifacts outside the local process.

`agent_task_package` records:

```text
source review artifact index
surface
disclosure_policy
evidence_packet
prompt metadata
local safety boundary
```

The disclosure policy defaults to metadata and local artifact references only. Raw screenshots, trace contents, raw DOM, console payloads, network payloads, sourceData values, and report bodies are excluded by default. The command writes content-free receipts with hashes, included evidence classes, sensitive artifact reference types, and explicit `api_call_performed=false`.

`agent_request_status` records:

```text
package id, package path, prompt path, receipt path
source review artifact index and review id
task and surface
status: waiting_for_agent | advisory_imported
imported result paths and latest result path
advisory finding count and owner decision request count
local safety boundary flags
```

The request status command is a local index over package/result metadata. It does not execute an agent, call a provider API, upload evidence, store credentials, mutate review artifacts, or change deterministic gates.

`agent_request_detail` records one request's local handoff detail:

```text
package path, prompt path, receipt path
status and selected/latest result paths
source review artifact index metadata
package disclosure policy and local artifact-reference summary
bounded advisory finding/action/owner-decision counts
dashboard handoff hints and local safety boundary flags
```

The request detail command is read-only over local package/result metadata. It does not write artifacts, execute an agent, call a provider API, upload evidence, store credentials, mutate review artifacts, or change deterministic gates.

`agent_workflow` records one local dashboard or automation handoff workflow:

```text
workflow id, name, path, receipt path, and evaluated time
package path, prompt path, request status, and request detail
step state for package, agent review, ingest, and report
dashboard handoff commands for status, index, ingest, and report
provider boundary flags
local safety boundary flags
```

Workflow create writes only local workflow metadata and a receipt under `.browser-debug/`. Workflow status and index are read-only over workflow/package/result metadata. Workflow report writes a bounded local Markdown status summary. These commands do not execute an agent, call a provider API, upload evidence, store credentials, mutate review artifacts, expose MCP agent execution, or change deterministic gates.

`agent_advisory_result` records imported advisory output as untrusted text. It may include visual design, content information architecture, user journey, mock interpretation, implementation diagnosis, accessibility advisory, and evidence-quality categories. It must set `gate_effect="none"`, `legacy_action_plan_unchanged=true`, `legacy_release_readiness_unchanged=true`, and `blocking_release_gate=false`. Imported advisory output must never execute shell commands, browser actions, file edits, cleanup, publication, dependency changes, manifest mutations, or external uploads.

## Agent Execution Contract

The agent execution layer is an additive bridge from local packages to local subscription runners or API provider adapters. The current implementation covers the no-network dry-run plan, explicit run parser/API surface, dedicated provider adapter registry, deterministic fake provider, configured local runner callback boundary, env-only generic API provider adapter, local status, and local list contract. This layer is not a replacement for review, workflow, ingest, or report commands. It must keep the existing package, workflow, ingest, report, resource, daemon, cleanup, and review contracts intact.

`agent_execution` records:

```text
execution id, name, path, receipt path, created time, updated time
package path, prompt path, source review artifact index, workflow path
surface id, surface kind, provider id, model id, runner id
mode: dry_run_plan | run
status: planned | running | completed | failed | blocked
step state for plan, runner/provider call, advisory normalization, ingest, and report
advisory result path, normalized result summary, and dashboard handoff commands
credential requirement names and credential source labels without values
disclosure policy, evidence transfer policy, and artifact class summary
boundary flags and gate effect
```

The dry-run command:

```text
browser-debug agent execution plan --package <agent-package> --surface <surface-id> --provider <provider-id> --model <model-id> --json
```

is the default no-network operation. It validates the package, resolves the surface, records the disclosure policy, records provider/model selection metadata, and writes local plan metadata plus a receipt under `.browser-debug/agent-executions/`. It sets `api_call_performed=false`, `external_evidence_transfer=false`, `automatic_upload=false`, `credential_values_recorded=false`, `credential_storage="none"`, `persistent_credential_storage=false`, `raw_response_stored=false`, `raw_provider_response_stored=false`, `existing_review_mutated=false`, and `gate_effect="none"`. When invoked through stdio MCP `admin`, it also records `mcp_execution_exposed=true` and a hashed idempotency key; direct CLI plans keep `mcp_execution_exposed=false`.

The run command:

```text
browser-debug agent execution run --execution <agent-execution> --package <agent-package> --surface <surface-id> --provider <provider-id> --model <model-id> --execute --json
```

requires a prior dry-run execution record and an explicit `--execute` flag, and fails deterministically without either. Runtime validation rejects package, surface, provider, or model mismatches between the run request and the dry-run plan. The provider adapter registry is dedicated to agent execution and is not reachable from review, resource, daemon, cleanup, Playwright, visual review, or shell paths. The stdio MCP `admin` execution tools reuse this same CLI/core path instead of implementing a separate provider adapter path.

Implemented providers:

- `fake-agent`: deterministic local provider for no-browser provider success/failure and dashboard contract coverage. It performs no API call or external transfer.
- `local-runner`: configured local runner callback boundary for subscription-style execution. It uses provider/model identifiers and package API context callbacks, not free-form shell input or SaaS web UI automation.
- `generic-api-provider`: one-shot provider API adapter. It reads endpoint and credential values only from `BROWSER_DEBUG_AGENT_API_ENDPOINT` and `BROWSER_DEBUG_AGENT_API_TOKEN`, never from CLI arguments, committed files, package artifacts, workflow files, reports, receipts, `.env` auto-loading, or persistent local storage. Tests use injected transports rather than live network calls.

Execution may send only bounded package and prompt content allowed by the disclosure policy. By default, it must not transfer raw screenshots, trace contents, raw DOM, console payloads, network payloads, sourceData values, report bodies, cookies, storage state, existing browser profile data, or raw review artifacts. API execution must record that an API call occurred and which bounded evidence classes were sent, but it must not store raw provider responses. Runner/provider output is normalized into `agent_advisory_result` and remains untrusted advisory data.

MCP exposure is limited to stdio `admin` tools `browser_debug_agent_execution_plan` and `browser_debug_agent_execution_run`. The run tool requires `execute: true`, package/surface/provider/model arguments, an idempotency key, and a matching prior execution plan. The MCP layer rejects unknown tool arguments so credentials, endpoint values, tokens, or environment values cannot be supplied as MCP arguments. Safe, full, and HTTP MCP profiles do not expose these execution tools.

`agent execution status --execution <path> --json` reads one local execution record and reports current state, normalized advisory result path, missing credential hints, receipt paths, dashboard handoff commands, dashboard status fields, and boundary flags. `agent execution list --json` scans local execution records and returns aggregate planned/running/completed/failed/blocked counts, advisory-result counts, and boundary flags for dashboards and local automation. Status and list are read-only and must not launch browsers, call providers, upload evidence, store credentials, write review artifacts, or change deterministic gates.

The planned layer keeps dashboard user experience aligned across subscription and API modes:

```text
agent package -> agent execution plan/run -> agent execution status/list -> agent ingest/report -> agent workflow status/index/report
```

It does not change review `findings`, `metrics.finding_count`, existing `action_plan`, `quality_signals.release_readiness`, `resource_guard`, artifact cleanup behavior, target manifest behavior, or existing `agent_workflow` status meanings.

## Agentic Human Review Responses Adapter Contract

The Responses adapter is a local bridge for manual Agentic Human Review dogfood. It is started separately from the main CLI execution flow with `npm run ahr:responses-adapter`. The existing `agentic review run` command still owns proposal, plan, plan-hash, transfer-flag, `--execute`, receipt, advisory normalization, and report-quality semantics.

The generic provider endpoint should point to the loopback adapter URL. The adapter then converts the TraceCue request into a Responses-compatible provider request and dispatches it upstream. This keeps upstream provider details, model choice, endpoint override, and provider credential loading out of the approved AHR plan/run artifact contract.

Adapter configuration is environment-variable and option driven:

- `AGENTIC_HUMAN_REVIEW_API_TOKEN`: local adapter bearer token expected from TraceCue's generic provider call.
- `AGENTIC_HUMAN_REVIEW_OPENAI_API_KEY`: preferred upstream provider key environment variable for the adapter.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: fallback upstream provider key environment variable for developer convenience.
- `AGENTIC_HUMAN_REVIEW_OPENAI_MODEL`: upstream model name when the approved plan does not supply a usable model id.
- `AGENTIC_HUMAN_REVIEW_OPENAI_RESPONSES_ENDPOINT`: optional upstream endpoint override for compatible providers.
- `AGENTIC_HUMAN_REVIEW_API_ENDPOINT`: generic provider endpoint; for this flow it should be the adapter loopback URL.
- `AGENTIC_HUMAN_REVIEW_API_TIMEOUT_MS`: optional positive-integer timeout for the TraceCue generic provider request. The default remains 30000 ms.
- Adapter `--timeout <ms>`: optional positive-integer timeout for the adapter's upstream provider request. This is intentionally separate from `AGENTIC_HUMAN_REVIEW_API_TIMEOUT_MS`; long live dogfood runs must align both values explicitly. The adapter startup output must report the effective timeout without printing credential values.

For long loopback dogfood, TraceCue's generic provider path, the Responses adapter's upstream provider path, and the packaged adapter CLI startup path use a repository-local bounded HTTP(S) transport by default instead of relying on bundled fetch transport defaults. The transport is still timeout, redirect, response-size, and credential-disclosure bounded by the existing provider contracts; injected test transports remain supported. This prevents a hidden client header-timeout default from ending an approved slow dogfood run before the configured `AGENTIC_HUMAN_REVIEW_API_TIMEOUT_MS` or adapter `--timeout` value.

Boundary behavior:

- The adapter binds only to loopback hosts and rejects non-loopback Host or Origin headers.
- The adapter accepts POST requests only on the exact configured path.
- The inbound adapter bearer token is never forwarded upstream; the upstream Authorization header uses the separate provider key.
- Provider model resolution is source-aware and fail-closed. The adapter resolves the upstream model from explicit adapter configuration, then the provider model environment variable, then the approved TraceCue request model. Abstract or local-only placeholder ids such as `generic-agentic-review-model`, fake-provider models, and injected-runner models are rejected before provider fetch, and diagnostics report only the source, env name, requested id, blocked id, and effective id when available.
- Raw pixel bytes, local plan paths, local execution paths, and local filesystem references are rejected or stripped before provider dispatch.
- The provider request sets `store: false`, sends no provider tools, requests JSON advisory output, and treats all page/evidence text as untrusted evidence.
- Benchmark-enabled provider output must include exact required-mention, required-dimension, and forbidden-claim records with non-empty evidence and evidence-reference ids from the request catalog. Unknown evidence-reference ids are not converted into local references.
- Forbidden-claim records are absence records. A `present=false` value means the forbidden claim is absent from the advisory output; coverage-style fields such as `covered` do not make the forbidden claim present unless the record explicitly says the claim was detected.
- Bounded contract repair retries may request a complete replacement advisory object when benchmark or `xhigh` mechanical fields are incomplete, but repair retries do not expand transfer permission, provider authority, credential handling, raw response storage, or claim permission.
- Provider responses are parsed in memory, size bounded, normalized to advisory JSON, redacted, and not stored as raw provider responses.
- Upstream provider request failures may report only allowlisted diagnostics such as timeout, duration, failure class, and safe cause/code metadata. They must not print stack traces, credential values, raw provider responses, provider request bodies, or credential-bearing endpoints.
- Adapter output remains advisory-only with `gate_effect: none`; it does not mutate deterministic findings, metrics, release gates, existing review artifacts, MCP permissions, or visual review artifacts.

The TraceCue `generic-api-provider` descriptor exposes a separate model-resolution contract:

```text
default_model: provider-neutral abstract placeholder
abstract_model_ids: provider-declared non-executable placeholders
runtime_model_env: environment variable name for a concrete upstream model
model_resolution_policy: explicit plan/run model or runtime model env required for live adapter execution
```

`agentic review plan` may preserve an abstract default model for provider-neutral planning and plan-hash review. `agentic review run` resolves the effective provider model before building the API payload. If the approved plan/run model is abstract and the runtime model environment variable is not configured, the run fails with `AGENTIC_REVIEW_PROVIDER_MODEL_UNRESOLVED` before fetch, before provider calls, and before evidence transfer. Successful runtime-env fallback records `model_resolution` in the provider payload, execution record, run receipt, and advisory result without recording credential values or raw provider responses.

## MCP Adapter Contract

MCP compatibility is implemented as an adapter, not as the product owner layer. The CLI remains the complete source of truth.

The stdio MCP adapter:

- Uses local process stdio communication.
- Preserves compatibility by resolving no-profile `browser-debug-mcp` and packaged `.mcp.json` launches to the `full` profile.
- Calls the same CLI/core contracts used by local commands.
- Exposes profile-selected allowlists from the reusable profile registry.
- Returns the same envelope families as the CLI.

The safe HTTP MCP transport:

- Is launched explicitly with `browser-debug-mcp --transport http --profile safe --host 127.0.0.1 --port <port>`.
- Binds only to loopback hosts and rejects non-loopback bind hosts.
- Requires a bearer token from `BROWSER_DEBUG_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` by default. Token values are never returned in public metadata or error responses.
- Validates Host and Origin headers as loopback when present.
- Limits request body size and accepts one JSON-RPC object per POST in this phase.
- Returns `MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18` with JSON responses.
- Exposes only the same safe-profile tool surface as stdio.

The MCP client configuration helper:

- Is launched through `browser-debug mcp config --json`.
- Produces reusable JSON for humans, shell scripts, Codex, and other MCP-capable agents.
- Uses `browser-debug-mcp` as the package-level command in generated examples.
- Includes `local_checkout` metadata with the current package root, MCP bin path, and `node`-based launch/config objects for agents that are using a local checkout before publication or installation.
- Defaults generated stdio client configuration to the `safe` profile; packaged `.mcp.json` remains the compatibility `full` profile.
- Defaults generated HTTP client configuration to safe profile, loopback host, `/mcp`, `BROWSER_DEBUG_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN`, and a fixed local client port suitable for external MCP client settings.
- Does not launch a listener, mutate files, contact the network, read token values, print token values, or create credentials.
- Reports `token_env` and placeholder authorization header syntax only.

The MCP capability policy helper:

- Is launched through `browser-debug mcp capabilities --json`.
- Can filter output by `--profile safe|full|admin|all` and `--scope all|profiles|excluded`.
- Reports supported transports, launch-selected profile surfaces, the current admin policy, and excluded operations.
- Records that `admin` is distinct from `full`, exposes only the approved stdio agent execution plan/run tools and approved stdio persistent session tools, and keeps unrelated write/execute tools excluded.
- Does not launch a listener, mutate files, contact the network, read token values, print token values, create credentials, or broaden MCP permissions.

The `safe` profile is no-browser, no-delete, no-provider, no-shell, and no-external-listener in its tool effects. It includes no-browser discovery, schema, target validation, resource status, artifact planning, read-only local agent advisory/status inspection, and MCP capability policy inspection. The `full` profile remains a stdio compatibility profile for local observe/review/target workflows plus bounded process-scoped supervise. The `admin` profile remains explicit and adds only the approved stdio agent execution plan/run bridge and approved stdio persistent session tools.

MCP does not expose artifact cleanup execution, package generation, ingest, report writing, workflow creation, execution planning outside the approved stdio `admin` agent execution plan bridge, `agent execution run` outside the approved stdio `admin` path, provider/API execution outside the approved agent execution adapter path, persistent session control outside stdio `admin`, arbitrary shell execution, browser profile reuse, default storage-state persistence, OAuth, external upload, credential handling, or gate mutation. HTTP transport does not expose `full`, `admin`, or persistent session tools.

Any socket MCP transport, remote HTTP listener, HTTP `full` or `admin` profile, MCP cleanup execution, MCP agent/API execution beyond approved stdio `admin` agent execution plan/run, shell tool, credential-bearing workflow, external model integration, external upload, or existing-profile reuse requires separate approval, security documentation, and tests.

## Browser Modes

- `headless`: default fast mode for structured observation and regression debugging.
- `headed`: visible browser mode for final UI/UX quality, animation, hover, focus, and operation feel.
- `devtools`: headed mode with DevTools for targeted inspection.

Long-running browser supervision is opt-in. `supervise` is process-scoped, uses an ephemeral context, does not reuse a user's normal browser profile, and closes before CLI exit. `daemon start` is background-scoped, uses a detached local worker with an ephemeral context, writes only ignored local metadata and observations, and stops through `daemon stop`. The default `observe` path still launches an ephemeral context, collects the requested evidence, and closes cleanly after one page observation.

## AI Interaction Contract

The CLI should expose structured observations and action candidates. The AI decides the next action outside the CLI, then sends that action back to the CLI. This keeps the tool agent-independent and avoids binding the product to one model, one chat UI, or one MCP runtime.

Review output should distinguish deterministic findings, heuristic findings, model-advisory findings, and owner-required decisions. "No findings" means no configured rule violation was observed; it must not be presented as proof that the design is good.

## Artifact Contract

Artifacts should be local by default and written under an ignored product workspace directory such as `.browser-debug/`. Planned artifact types include:

- screenshots
- traces
- console summaries
- network failure summaries
- accessibility summaries
- action history
- issue reports

Sensitive browser data must not be emitted unless a later approved feature defines safe redaction and explicit consent.

The initial artifact layout is:

```text
.browser-debug/
  sessions/
  observations/
  screenshots/
  traces/
  reports/
  specs/
  daemons/
  targets/
  reviews/
  layouts/
  diffs/
  coverage/
  review-artifacts/
  receipts/
```

Committed files must not include `.browser-debug/`, screenshots, traces, cookies, storage state, existing browser profiles, credentials, or secret-like values.

The default artifact retention policy is manual retention. Browser Debug CLI does not automatically delete generated artifacts and does not upload artifacts. Developers may remove the ignored `.browser-debug/` root themselves after reviewing whether screenshots, traces, reports, or session metadata are still needed, or run explicit artifact-root-scoped cleanup with `resource artifacts cleanup --execute`. Built-in cleanup must remain explicit, local-only, receipt-backed, tested, and limited to selected regular files under the configured artifact root.

## JSON Output Contract

Every command that supports `--json` should return an object with these top-level fields:

```text
schema_version
command
status
observed_at
data
warnings
errors
artifacts
```

Errors must be structured and non-secret-bearing. Page content, console output, network data, screenshots, traces, and model suggestions remain untrusted data.

## Schema Versioning Contract

The local MVP schema version is `0.1.0`. This version applies to top-level JSON envelopes, artifact descriptors, local session metadata, daemon metadata, supervision metadata, observation artifacts, and spec exports unless a file declares a more specific artifact schema.

Compatible changes may add fields while keeping existing field names, meanings, and JSON types stable. Breaking changes include renaming fields, removing fields, changing field types, or changing status/error vocabulary semantics; those changes require a schema version bump, synchronized product documents, and regression tests.

`doctor --json` exposes `data.schema_version_policy` and `data.artifact_retention` so agents and scripts can inspect the current compatibility and artifact-retention policy without scraping documents.

## Plugin Bundle Contract

The repository includes local Codex plugin metadata:

```text
.codex-plugin/plugin.json
.mcp.json
skills/browser-debug-review/SKILL.md
templates/review-target-manifest.json
```

The plugin bundle points to the local stdio MCP adapter and the plugin-facing review skill. It does not register a marketplace entry, publish a package, change the license, add external upload, add OAuth, add credential storage, or change the packaged `.mcp.json` into an HTTP endpoint. The optional HTTP MCP transport is a separate explicit safe-profile launch mode.

## Runtime Security Contract

- Browser contexts are ephemeral by default.
- Existing browser profiles and credentials are not read or written.
- Cookies, storage state, and local storage values are not printed, committed, or exported by default. The only supported storageState persistence path is explicit admin opt-in under the configured artifact auth directory with value-silent receipts.
- Artifact root paths must stay inside the current workspace.
- Observation and report data applies basic redaction to common secret-like strings and sensitive URL query parameters.
- Trace zip files are raw local evidence and can contain unredacted page content. They must remain under ignored `.browser-debug/` paths unless a future approved workflow defines safer handling.
- Process-scoped supervision and background daemon supervision both use ephemeral contexts. The background daemon does not create a persistent browser profile, persistent storage state, external control channel, HTTP listener, socket server, or artifact upload path.
- Persistent browser sessions do not use existing profiles, `launchPersistentContext`, or `userDataDir`. They retain only a Playwright context created by TraceCue, enforce TTL/idle shutdown, communicate through local artifact-root command files, and close context/browser on stop or expiry.

## OSS Workflow Contract

The repository should move through these phases:

- Phase 0: scaffold and synchronized planning documents.
- Phase 1: local Git initialization and first commit.
- Phase 2a: package/runtime design without network, dependency installation, or runtime implementation.
- Phase 2b: public GitHub repository creation through `gh`.
- Phase 3: GitHub Actions CI.
- Phase 4: npm package metadata and CLI packaging implementation.
- Phase 5: MVP Playwright implementation.
- Phase 6: release and npm publish flow.

The current repository implements local CI configuration, local CI validation, release readiness documentation, dry-run package verification, public GitHub repository creation, `origin/main` synchronization, and remote GitHub Actions `main` CI verification. It does not execute npm publication or other public release actions.

## Out of Scope for Phase 0

- Runtime CLI implementation.
- Dependency installation.
- Browser launch.
- GitHub remote creation.
- npm package publication.
- Remote CI workflow execution.

## Out of Scope for Phase 2a

- Dependency installation.
- Browser launch.
- Runtime Playwright implementation.
- GitHub remote creation.
- Remote CI workflow execution.
- npm package publication.

## Out of Scope for the Current Local MVP

- Existing browser profile reuse.
- Authentication automation, OAuth flows, webhook handling, external upload, and credential storage.
- Remote trace storage or trace upload.
- GitHub remote setup, remote CI workflow execution, npm publication, or external upload.

## Out of Scope for the Review Platform MVP

- Full Playwright API parity.
- Full Playwright MCP tool parity.
- Human-style subjective design approval as deterministic proof.
- Model or vision review as a required dependency.
- External model/API calls without explicit opt-in.
- Product-specific runtime branches for individual applications.
- Persistent browser profile reuse, default storageState persistence, authentication automation, OAuth, webhooks, or credential storage.
- Socket MCP server mode, remote HTTP MCP listeners, HTTP `full` or `admin` MCP profiles, MCP execution tools, or arbitrary shell execution.

## Visual Evidence Core Contract

Visual evidence records use the `visual_evidence` schema and are stored as metadata JSON under `.browser-debug/visual-evidence/`. A record contains the source kind, source path or artifact reference, media byte size, SHA-256 hash, media type, dimensions when detectable, labels, masks, regions, privacy flags, and boundary flags.

The core recognizes browser screenshots, image files, mock images, screen captures, window captures, and desktop app captures as source kinds. Step 2 implements the shared metadata and path-confinement layer and attaches metadata-only records to existing browser screenshot capture paths. Later phases may add CLI image review, AI visual review, MCP planning, approved MCP execution, screen/window capture, desktop review, and multi-agent review on top of this shared core.

The core is local-only. It does not embed raw pixels in JSON, call providers, upload evidence, store credentials, store raw provider responses, expose MCP execution, mutate existing review artifacts, or change deterministic review gates.

## Phase 43 Standalone Image Review

Standalone image review is implemented as `review --image <workspace-file> --json`. It is a no-browser mode that uses the visual evidence core to read a workspace-relative image file, records metadata-only visual evidence, writes an `image_review` result under `reviews/`, writes a review artifact index under `review-artifacts/`, and optionally writes a Markdown report. It performs deterministic evidence-quality checks only and does not claim aesthetic approval or human-equivalent visual judgment.

## Phase 51 Desktop Image Review From Capture Handoff

Desktop image review extends standalone image review with optional capture handoff verification:

```text
trace-cue capture handoff --image <workspace-image> --source screen|window|desktop-app --json > capture-handoff.json
trace-cue review --image <workspace-image> --capture-handoff <workspace-json|-> --json
trace-cue visual review prepare --review-index <review-artifact-index> --json
```

`review --image --capture-handoff` reads the handoff JSON, accepts full envelopes or inner `capture_handoff` objects, requires `status=metadata_only`, requires source kind `screen_capture`, `window_capture`, or `desktop_app_capture`, verifies `source.path` against the reviewed workspace image path, and verifies `media.sha256` against the reviewed image bytes. After those checks pass, the image review and visual evidence metadata record the caller-declared source kind, capture handoff id, handoff input path or input source, handoff hash, source path match, and media hash match.

The command still does not perform OS capture, enumerate screens, enumerate windows, enumerate processes, launch a browser, call providers, transfer evidence, expose MCP execution, or claim human-equivalent visual judgment. The provenance remains caller-declared and `source_verified_by_trace_cue=false` until a separate approved capture execution phase exists.

## Phase 53-55 Visual Review Aggregation

`visual review aggregate --preparation <workspace-json> --json` is a read-only aggregation command over existing local visual review result artifacts:

```text
trace-cue visual review aggregate --preparation .browser-debug/visual-review-results/<id>/preparation.json --json
```

The command reads the selected preparation JSON and scans existing `.browser-debug/visual-review-results/*/result.json` records whose `preparation_id` or `preparation_path` matches that preparation. It optionally reads matching `execution.json` metadata. It returns `visual_review_aggregation` with source metadata, result and reviewer counts, source effects, reviewer summaries, source-attributed aggregation findings, conflict records, owner decision requests, the original query, `gate_effect=none`, and read-only boundary flags.

Aggregation groups untrusted visual advisory findings deterministically by category, message, route, and viewport. A group is `corroborated` when more than one reviewer source reports it. Severity disagreements are preserved as conflicts that require owner review. Text fields are bounded, malformed artifacts are skipped with warnings, result scanning is limit-bound, and no raw provider response body is stored.

Aggregation never writes artifacts, runs providers, reads raw pixels, reads credentials, mutates existing reviews, changes deterministic findings, changes release gates, or exposes a MCP tool. `mcp capabilities` and `mcp execution gates` report `visual_review_aggregation` as currently excluded from safe/full/admin MCP profiles until separate read-exposure gates are approved.

## Agentic Human Review Editorial Synthesis

Agentic Human Review advisory results may include an optional top-level `editorial_synthesis` object. This object is a derived editorial view over the normalized advisory result, not provider-authored proof. It is built after result normalization from existing sections such as `human_report_v3`, `reader_experience_review`, `mechanical_vs_human_review`, reported `role_opinions`, `agentic_human_review_findings`, `owner_baseline_findings`, consensus/dissent summaries, action-plan suggestions, and owner decision requests.

The synthesis contract includes `schema_version`, `synthesis_version`, `status`, `audience`, `tone`, `language`, `language_resolution`, `one_sentence_takeaway`, `full_review`, `key_observations`, `key_tensions`, `strengths`, `risks_or_cautions`, `recommended_direction`, `owner_decision_summary`, `limitations`, `source_refs`, `source_ref_details`, `boundary`, `advisory_only=true`, and `gate_effect=none`. `source_refs` identify existing result sections and ids, while `source_ref_details` provide machine-readable `source_field`, `source_id`, and `source_kind` values without raw artifact bodies, provider prompts, provider responses, credentials, execution internals, or local paths.

The synthesis builder is local and deterministic. It resolves TraceCue-local language settings during `agentic review run`, stores bounded `language_settings` metadata in the normalized advisory result, and uses `artifact_output.language` as the preferred `editorial_synthesis.language` when that artifact language is resolved. If artifact output language is unresolved, the builder uses local source-text inference as a fallback and records the unresolved status in `language_resolution`. When artifact output language differs from the inferred source language, the builder preserves existing source advisory text, records `translation_execution_enabled=false`, `raw_evidence_translated=false`, `provider_output_translated=false`, and `report_body_translated=false`, and adds a limitation rather than pretending translation occurred.

The synthesis builder must not call providers, request `editorial_synthesis` or language-settings output in provider prompts or adapter schemas, read raw pixels, translate source evidence, translate provider output, transfer evidence, read credential values, store raw provider responses, expose MCP execution, mutate deterministic findings, change report-quality metrics, satisfy owner-baseline proof, repair benchmark coverage, alter claim integrity, authorize owner decisions, or change release gates. If the normalized result has too few evidence-backed findings or reported role opinions, the synthesis must use a limited status and state the limitation instead of fabricating a richer review.

Markdown Agentic Human Review reports render an `Editorial Synthesis` section from the existing result field only, including bounded language-setting metadata for the synthesis language, artifact output language, artifact language mode, text direction, translation mode, translation execution flag, and source-text preservation flag. Older results that do not contain `editorial_synthesis` remain valid and render without that section.

## Agentic Human Review Responses Adapter Contract Recovery

Responses adapter post-validation now evaluates all applicable TraceCue contracts before deciding whether a provider advisory is repairable. The validation families are benchmark coverage, owner-approved human-baseline coverage, optional `review_claims` filtering, and either full `xhigh` role/round/critique/synthesis completion or staged-role completion when `stage_execution` is present.

When more than one family fails, the adapter returns the first failure code for backward-compatible status classification and includes `contract_failures` plus merged missing-record details in `error.details`. Repair context uses missing-only templates: satisfied benchmark or owner-baseline rows are not repeated, required owner-baseline finding templates are filtered to missing criterion ids, and allowed evidence ids are derived first from missing records and recommended evidence-reference ids before falling back to the bounded evidence catalog.

For staged `standard`, `deep`, and `xhigh` requests, the adapter validates only the roles and round required by the current stage. Final contract stages must also include synthesis integration. This keeps staged provider calls compatible with the approved multi-call plan while preventing a final-stage response from bypassing TraceCue's mechanical effort and proof contracts.

Generic-provider and staged-provider failure records persist a safe diagnostic subset under `failure_diagnostics.details`. The subset may include provider/adapter error codes, messages, status and byte counts, timeout and duration numbers, model-resolution metadata, stage id/round/roles, contract failure summaries, missing benchmark or owner-baseline records, and recommended evidence-reference ids. It must not persist raw provider responses, raw response bodies, request payloads, provider request bodies, credentials, authorization headers, endpoint strings, URL strings, local paths, cookies, sessions, stack traces, or arbitrary nested payloads.

The adapter CLI accepts and documents `--max-request-bytes` and `--max-provider-response-bytes`, and startup JSON reports the effective values. These limits are configuration for approved dogfood runs, not hidden product-specific constants.

When effective benchmark coverage is active, the adapter's provider JSON schema requires the nested `benchmark_requirement_coverage.required_mentions`, `required_dimensions`, and `forbidden_claims` arrays and derives their `minItems` from the active required coverage templates. Repair context includes `coverage_repair_targets` keyed by JSON path so providers can repair missing forbidden-claim absence rows without repeating satisfied rows. After at least one provider repair attempt, the adapter may complete only missing forbidden-claim absence rows from canonical required coverage templates when the advisory does not assert the forbidden claim and a valid local evidence-reference catalog id is available. Such records are marked with adapter-derived provenance and remain advisory-only; required mentions, required dimensions, owner-baseline findings, and prose-derived coverage are not synthesized.

When full replacement repair is exhausted and the remaining contract failure is limited to missing benchmark coverage rows whose records are absent, the adapter may issue one bounded coverage patch request to the same provider boundary. The patch request includes the prior provider-authored advisory as redacted, size-bounded context, the missing-row `coverage_repair_targets`, and allowed evidence-reference ids. The provider must return only `benchmark_requirement_coverage`; the adapter merges only rows whose exact label matches a missing record and whose evidence references resolve to the local catalog, marks those rows as provider coverage patch repair output, and then re-runs the same benchmark, owner-baseline, claim, and effort validation. Invalid existing rows, unknown evidence references, non-coverage failures, disabled full repair, target-specific branches, prose-only matches, owner-baseline finding projection, local artifact inference, raw response persistence, credential recording, MCP exposure, and release-gate mutation remain out of scope.

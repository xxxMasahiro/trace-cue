## Session State

- Future development in this repository should be conducted in English.
- Phase 1 is complete.
- Local Git is initialized on `main`.
- Initial scaffold commit: `87e39f5 Initial browser debug CLI scaffold`.
- Product-gate evidence is recorded under `.git/product-gate-evidence/`.
- Phase 2a package/runtime design has started; the next approval-bound step is runtime/package implementation or, separately, public GitHub repository creation.

## 2026-06-17 Phase 2a Package/Runtime Design

- Began package/runtime design under `skills/product-development-workflow/SKILL.md`.
- At that point, no runtime implementation, dependency installation, GitHub repository creation, CI, npm work, push, or browser launch had been performed.
- Working CLI binary is `browser-debug`.
- Runtime baseline is Node.js 20 or newer with ESM modules.
- First implementation slice is `doctor`, command parsing, deterministic JSON errors, and focused tests.
- First Playwright slice is one-shot `observe --url <url> --json` with an ephemeral context and ignored `.browser-debug/` artifacts.
- Phase 2a design verification passed with `./tools/product-gate`.
- Implemented the first no-browser runtime/package slice: private local package metadata, `browser-debug` bin, ESM CLI modules, `doctor`, parser, deterministic JSON errors, planned-command stubs, and `tests/cli.test.js`. This was superseded by the later Playwright-backed local MVP.
- At that point, `observe --url <url> --json` validated the URL and returned an explicit unimplemented error without launching a browser. This was superseded by the later Playwright-backed local MVP.
- `npm test` is wired into `./tools/product-gate` through `./tools/test_product_repository.sh`.
- Verification passed with `npm test`, `./tools/product-gate`, `git diff --check`, `doctor --json`, and the no-browser `observe` stub.
- That approval boundary was later crossed for local Playwright implementation, then for public GitHub repository creation, remote setup, push, and remote `main` CI after developer approval.

## 2026-06-17 Local MVP Runtime

- Installed `playwright` as a runtime dependency.
- Implemented Playwright-backed `observe --url <url> --json` with ephemeral Chromium contexts, structured page observation, local observation artifacts, optional screenshots, console summaries, failed-request summaries, and basic redaction.
- Implemented `observe --trace` with local Playwright trace zip artifacts and trace-content warnings.
- Implemented local `.browser-debug/` artifact handling for sessions, observations, screenshots, reports, and specs.
- Implemented `session start`, `session close`, simple `act`, `report`, and `spec export` using file-backed local session metadata.
- Implemented `supervise --url <url> --actions <json-array>` for process-scoped ephemeral browser supervision.
- Implemented `daemon start`, `daemon status`, and `daemon stop` for local background ephemeral browser supervision.
- Added `npm run test:browser` for real Playwright smoke coverage.
- Strengthened browser smoke coverage for form controls, keyboard input, deterministic scroll, wait actions, screenshots, reports, and spec export.
- Added deterministic headed/devtools launch-mode regression coverage without requiring a GUI display.
- Added `npm run test:pack` local package dry-run verification using an ignored local npm cache.
- Added `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/workflow/RELEASE.md` for local release readiness without publishing.
- Added browser smoke coverage for supervised ordered actions in one ephemeral context.
- Added architecture regression coverage for generic runtime boundaries, shared evidence helpers, and local Node CLI packaging.
- Added architecture and browser smoke coverage for local daemon boundaries and start/status/stop.
- Added local GitHub Actions CI configuration, `ops/CI_MANIFEST.tsv`, `tools/check_product_ci.sh`, and `npm run release:check` without remote execution or publishing.
- Verification passed with `npm test`, `npm run test:browser`, `node ./bin/browser-debug.js doctor --json`, Dashboard Control Center observation at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`, screenshot review, and trace artifact existence checks.
- `http://127.0.0.1:5174/` was not listening during verification.
- Final checks also passed with `./tools/product-gate`, `git diff --check`, lesson-side product scaffold check, lesson-side product repository authority status, and lesson-side workflow-pair sync check.
- Completed after developer approval: public GitHub repository creation at `https://github.com/xxxMasahiro/browser-debug-cli`, remote `origin` setup, local `main` fast-forward, `origin/main` push, and GitHub Actions `main` CI verification.
- Updated GitHub Actions checkout and Node setup actions to v5 after the first remote run reported Node 20 action-runtime deprecation annotations.
- Next approval-bound work: public package naming, license changes, npm publication, existing-browser-profile reuse, OAuth/login automation, external daemon control channels, external upload, or credential storage.

## 2026-06-17 Phase 11 Review Handoff

- Phase 7 through Phase 10 review-platform work was completed before this state: deterministic review, target manifests, route and viewport coverage, risk-gated actions, conservative mock metrics, local stdio MCP adapter, plugin metadata, quality signals, expected route execution, and route-budget skip coverage.
- Phase 11 is complete for optional manifest `pages`, page-specific viewports, deterministic expected text and selector checks, page-level mock metrics, local `review_artifact_index` artifacts, `coverage.pages`, and `quality_signals.page_expectations`.
- The implementation remains generic and local-first. No Control Center-specific runtime branches, external upload, model/API review, OAuth/login automation, existing-profile reuse, HTTP/socket MCP transport, npm publication, license change, or marketplace mutation was added.
- Current local verification includes `npm test`, `npm run test:browser`, product-local checks, release readiness checks, and parent workflow authority checks.

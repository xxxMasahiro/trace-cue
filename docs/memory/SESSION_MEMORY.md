## Session State

- Future development in this repository should be conducted in English.
- Phase 1 is complete.
- Local Git is initialized on `main`.
- Initial scaffold commit: `87e39f5 Initial browser debug CLI scaffold`.
- Product-gate evidence is recorded under `.git/product-gate-evidence/`.
- Phase 2a package/runtime design has started; the next approval-bound step is runtime/package implementation or, separately, public GitHub repository creation.

## 2026-06-17 Phase 2a Package/Runtime Design

- Began package/runtime design under `skills/product-development-workflow/SKILL.md`.
- At that point, no runtime implementation, dependency installation, GitHub repository creation, CI, npm work, push, or browser launch had been performed.
- Working CLI binary is `browser-debug`.
- Runtime baseline is Node.js 20 or newer with ESM modules.
- First implementation slice is `doctor`, command parsing, deterministic JSON errors, and focused tests.
- First Playwright slice is one-shot `observe --url <url> --json` with an ephemeral context and ignored `.browser-debug/` artifacts.
- Phase 2a design verification passed with `./tools/product-gate`.
- Implemented the first no-browser runtime/package slice: private local package metadata, `browser-debug` bin, ESM CLI modules, `doctor`, parser, deterministic JSON errors, planned-command stubs, and `tests/cli.test.js`. This was superseded by the later Playwright-backed local MVP.
- At that point, `observe --url <url> --json` validated the URL and returned an explicit unimplemented error without launching a browser. This was superseded by the later Playwright-backed local MVP.
- `npm test` is wired into `./tools/product-gate` through `./tools/test_product_repository.sh`.
- Verification passed with `npm test`, `./tools/product-gate`, `git diff --check`, `doctor --json`, and the no-browser `observe` stub.
- That approval boundary was later crossed for local Playwright implementation only; public GitHub repository creation remains approval-bound.

## 2026-06-17 Local MVP Runtime

- Installed `playwright` as a runtime dependency.
- Implemented Playwright-backed `observe --url <url> --json` with ephemeral Chromium contexts, structured page observation, local observation artifacts, optional screenshots, console summaries, failed-request summaries, and basic redaction.
- Implemented `observe --trace` with local Playwright trace zip artifacts and trace-content warnings.
- Implemented local `.browser-debug/` artifact handling for sessions, observations, screenshots, reports, and specs.
- Implemented `session start`, `session close`, simple `act`, `report`, and `spec export` using file-backed local session metadata.
- Added `npm run test:browser` for real Playwright smoke coverage.
- Strengthened browser smoke coverage for form controls, keyboard input, deterministic scroll, wait actions, screenshots, reports, and spec export.
- Verification passed with `npm test`, `npm run test:browser`, `node ./bin/browser-debug.js doctor --json`, Dashboard Control Center observation at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`, screenshot review, and trace artifact existence checks.
- `http://127.0.0.1:5174/` was not listening during verification.
- Final checks also passed with `./tools/product-gate`, `git diff --check`, lesson-side product scaffold check, lesson-side product repository authority status, and lesson-side workflow-pair sync check.
- Next approval-bound work: GitHub repository creation, remote setup, push, CI, npm publication, long-running browser supervision, existing-browser-profile reuse, OAuth/login automation, external upload, or credential storage.

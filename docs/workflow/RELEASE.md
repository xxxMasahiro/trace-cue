# RELEASE.md

## Current Status

Browser Debug CLI is not released. The repository has local MVP runtime coverage, Phase 7 review-platform coverage, Phase 8 dogfood/plugin-readiness coverage, Phase 9 local review-quality coverage, Phase 10 route-readiness coverage, Phase 11 page-expectation and artifact-index coverage, Phase 12 rendered-state dogfood hardening coverage, Phase 14 content UX advisory coverage, Phase 15 content UX heuristic coverage, Phase 16 content UX handoff coverage, Phase 17 content UX practical handoff coverage, Phase 18 content UX review brief/rubric coverage, Phase 19 no-browser target manifest validation coverage, Phase 20 no-browser local resource status preflight coverage, Phase 21-24 local resource safety coverage, Phase 25 local agent advisory handoff coverage, a public GitHub repository, remote `main` synchronization, passing GitHub Actions `main` CI, CI manifest validation, and local package dry-run verification.

## Local Release Readiness Checks

Run these checks before any public release work is proposed:

```bash
npm test
npm run test:browser
npm run test:pack
npm run release:check
./tools/check_product_ci.sh
./tools/product-gate
```

The package dry-run uses an ignored local npm cache and must not publish:

```bash
npm pack --dry-run --json --cache .tmp/npm-cache
```

## Release Blockers

- Confirm the public npm package name and optional scope.
- Choose a release license and replace `UNLICENSED` only after approval.
- Confirm npm account, token handling, and publication method only after approval.
- Decide whether and where to register the local Codex plugin bundle.
- Treat `quality_signals.release_readiness` as a local review gate only; it does not authorize package publication or marketplace registration.
- Treat `quality_signals.content_ux`, `local_content_ux_advisory`, `content_ux_findings`, `content_ux_action_plan`, `content_ux_readiness`, `content_ux_page_handoff`, and `content_ux_manifest_authoring` as advisory-only target review output; they do not authorize package publication, marketplace registration, external evidence transfer, or automatic manifest mutation.
- Treat `artifact_index` as local artifact inventory and rerun guidance only; it does not authorize evidence transfer.
- Treat `agent package`, `agent ingest`, and `agent report` as local advisory handoff tooling only; they do not authorize direct provider API calls, external upload, credential storage, or release-gate changes.
- Treat `resource status` and `resource_guard` as local preflight signals only; they do not authorize host cleanup, system cache mutation, swap configuration, privileged helper use, external evidence transfer, or arbitrary process control.
- Treat `resource artifacts cleanup --execute` as a local artifact-root-only operation with receipts; it does not authorize automatic cleanup, host cache deletion, swap changes, cleanup outside `.browser-debug/`, or MCP cleanup execution.
- Do not upload traces, screenshots, session files, cookies, storage state, credentials, or `.browser-debug/` artifacts.
- Keep direct model/API execution, evidence leaving the local process, HTTP/socket MCP server mode, OAuth/login automation, and external upload approval-bound.

## Non-Goals Before Approval

- No `npm publish`.
- No OAuth, login automation, webhook setup, external upload, or credential storage.
- No direct model/API execution or evidence upload.
- No HTTP/socket MCP server mode.
- No plugin marketplace registration or installation-state mutation.
- No host memory-cache mutation, swap configuration, cleanup outside the configured artifact root, privileged helper execution, arbitrary process control, or MCP cleanup execution.

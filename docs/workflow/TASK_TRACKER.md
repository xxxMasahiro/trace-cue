## Future Approval-Bound Work

- [ ] If approved later, integrate model/API review outside the Phase 29 agent execution adapter boundary or send review evidence beyond the bounded package/prompt disclosure policy.
- [ ] If approved later, extend provider execution beyond the Phase 29 dry-run, explicit `--execute`, env-only credential, bounded-disclosure, local-receipt, advisory-only boundary.
- [ ] If approved later, expose any execution operation through MCP. Phase 29 keeps `agent execution run` out of MCP.
- [ ] If approved later, add socket MCP transport, remote HTTP MCP listeners, HTTP `full` or `admin` profiles, MCP execution tools, or remote control channels.
- [ ] If approved later, run real headed visual regression checks in an environment with a display.
- [ ] If approved later, choose the public package name and license.
- [ ] If approved later, publish the npm package after release checklist, CI, package name, license, and credential handling are complete.
- [ ] If approved later, register or install the Codex plugin in a marketplace.
- [ ] If approved later, design any host cleanup, system cache mutation, swap configuration, cleanup outside the configured artifact root, privileged helper execution, MCP cleanup execution, or arbitrary process-control workflow with separate security documentation and tests.

## Next Step

Phase 35 HTTP MCP integration hardening is locally implemented and ready for release proof, PR CI, main CI, and local/remote synchronization. Keep the completed work limited to token-free MCP client configuration output, documentation, and packed-install safe HTTP MCP handshake smoke coverage. Ask for explicit approval before evidence transfer outside the Phase 29 bounded disclosure policy, arbitrary source-data file or URL loaders, socket MCP transport, remote HTTP MCP listeners, HTTP `full` or `admin` MCP profiles, MCP execution tools, authentication automation, external daemon control channels, external upload, existing-browser-profile reuse, persistent credential storage, public package naming, license changes, plugin marketplace registration, npm publication, cleanup outside the configured artifact root, automatic cleanup, host memory-cache mutation, swap configuration, privileged helper execution, MCP cleanup execution, MCP agent execution, shell tools, or arbitrary process control.

## Stop Conditions

- Runtime Playwright implementation is requested before Phase 0 checks pass.
- GitHub public repository creation is requested without explicit approval.
- npm publish is requested before CI and release planning exist.
- Any secret, cookie, storage state, or credential-like data appears in repository files.
- A design change would require existing browser profile reuse, credential storage, OAuth, webhooks, external upload, or arbitrary shell execution without a security plan and approval.
- Review-platform runtime code introduces Dashboard Control Center or FrameCue Control Center-specific branches instead of generic target manifests.
- MCP adapter work introduces socket listeners, remote HTTP listeners, HTTP `full` or `admin`, arbitrary shell execution, cleanup execution tools, external upload, or persistent storage without explicit approval and security documentation.
- Resource safety work mutates system cache, changes swap configuration, deletes outside the configured artifact root, executes shell commands, uses privileged helpers, exposes MCP cleanup execution, or controls arbitrary processes without explicit approval and security documentation.
- Agent execution work changes existing deterministic review outputs, existing `agent_workflow` status meanings, resource guard behavior, artifact cleanup behavior, or release-readiness semantics.
- Agent execution work stores credential values, raw provider responses, raw screenshots, trace contents, raw DOM, console payloads, network payloads, sourceData values, report bodies, cookies, storage state, existing browser profile data, or raw review artifacts.
- Agent execution work bypasses dry-run planning, explicit `--execute`, env-only credential loading, local receipts, bounded disclosure, or advisory-only normalization.
- Agent execution work exposes execution through MCP, accepts free-form shell commands, automates SaaS web UIs, adds OAuth/login automation, persists credentials, or adds HTTP/socket provider control paths.

## Product-Local Commands

```bash
npm test
npm run test:rename-readiness
npm run test:browser
npm run test:pack
npm run test:pack-install
npm run release:check
./tools/check_product_structure.sh
./tools/check_product_docs.sh
./tools/check_product_security.sh
./tools/check_product_ci.sh
./tools/check_product_design_system.sh
./tools/test_product_repository.sh
./tools/product-gate
```

`./tools/test_product_repository.sh` and `./tools/product-gate` run structure, docs, security, CI manifest, design-system, product mode, `npm test`, `npm run test:rename-readiness`, `npm run test:pack`, and `npm run test:pack-install` when `package.json` is present. `npm run test:browser` is intentionally separate because it launches local Chromium. `npm run release:check` is a no-publish convenience wrapper for no-browser, rename-readiness, package dry-run, and packed install smoke checks.

## Planned Review Platform Checks

Phase 7 review-platform implementation includes focused checks before any release claim:

- Parser tests for `review --url`, `review --target`, `schema list`, `schema get`, and MCP adapter entrypoints.
- Schema tests for envelopes, artifacts, findings, target manifests, review results, and MCP tool metadata.
- No-browser unit tests for target manifest validation, viewport matrix expansion, action risk classification, redaction, shell-safe action input, and MCP tool output shape.
- Architecture tests that prevent application-specific runtime literals, persistent browser profile reuse, storage-state persistence, unapproved listeners, arbitrary shell execution, unapproved upload paths, and cleanup outside the configured artifact root.
- Browser smoke fixture tests for console errors, empty renders, horizontal overflow, clipped text, missing accessible names, nonblank screenshots, route coverage, viewport coverage, and local artifact placement.
- Mock comparison tests for local metrics and dimension mismatch `inconclusive` behavior.
- MCP adapter tests for stdio compatibility behavior, safe HTTP loopback/token boundaries, tool allowlists, schema-compatible responses, no shell tool, no cleanup execution tool, and no external upload by default.
- Resource status tests for no-browser local memory, swap, cgroup, pressure, process memory, warning/recommendation output, MCP wiring, and read-only host boundaries.
- Resource guard and artifact safety tests for advisory/fail-critical review output, daemon lifecycle metadata, artifact usage planning, explicit cleanup receipts, no MCP cleanup execution, and `.browser-debug/`-scoped deletion only.

Optional acceptance checks against local application servers may run only when those servers are listening. Those checks should use target manifests or fixtures and should not introduce product-specific branches into the runtime.

## Phase 8 Dogfood and Plugin Checks

- No-browser tests cover `target init`, generated manifest shape, MCP target tools, and plugin metadata boundaries.
- Browser smoke tests cover enriched findings, `action_plan`, `review_advisory`, target review reports, and route/viewport coverage artifacts.
- Architecture tests verify `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.mcp.json`, and `skills/browser-debug-review/SKILL.md` stay local and keep the packaged MCP config stdio-based.
- Plugin validation should pass with the local plugin validator before publication or marketplace work is proposed.
- Package dry-run verification must include plugin metadata, the plugin-facing skill, and the reusable target manifest template without publishing.

## Phase 9 Review Quality Checks

- Browser smoke tests cover `quality_signals` in single-URL and target review output.
- Browser smoke tests cover image alt text findings, low contrast findings, visible overlap findings, local release readiness, and disabled model-review boundaries.
- Markdown report smoke coverage verifies that the Quality Signals section is present.
- Architecture tests continue to block target-specific runtime branches, existing-profile reuse, storage-state persistence, unapproved listeners, arbitrary shell execution, unapproved upload paths, and cleanup outside the configured artifact root.

## Phase 10 Dogfood Route Checks

- Browser smoke tests cover unlinked manifest `expectedRoutes` being visited as explicit review targets.
- Browser smoke tests cover `coverage.routes.expected` and `quality_signals.route_coverage.expected_manifest_routes`.
- Browser smoke tests cover `route_budget_exceeded` skipped routes when `budgets.maxRoutes` prevents full coverage.
- These checks use local fixture pages so they do not depend on a specific application, framework, localhost port, route name, or UI label.

## Phase 11 Page Expectation Checks

- No-browser tests cover optional manifest `pages` normalization, page priority normalization, page-specific viewport merging, and generated manifests with empty `pages`.
- Browser smoke tests cover expected visible text, missing expected selectors, page-specific mobile viewport execution, page-level mock metrics, `coverage.pages`, `quality_signals.page_expectations`, local `review_artifact_index` artifacts, and Markdown report page expectation output.
- These checks use local fixture pages and do not depend on a specific application, framework, localhost port, route name, or UI label.

## Phase 12 Rendered-State Dogfood Checks

- Browser smoke tests cover broken visible images, visible loading indicators that remain after the review wait, and empty table/list/grid containers without visible empty-state messaging.
- Browser smoke tests cover `quality_signals.rendered_state`, `evidence_summary.loading_indicators`, `evidence_summary.empty_containers`, Developer Triage Markdown report output, and target `manifest_suggestions`.
- These checks use local fixture pages and do not depend on a specific application, framework, localhost port, route name, or UI label.

## Phase 13 Dogfood Signal Refinement Checks

- Browser smoke tests cover normal ready/progress business-state text and verify it is not reported as lingering loading UI.
- Loading indicator evidence remains limited to explicit loading semantics, loading-like attributes, roles, or short status text rather than arbitrary ancestor text.
- These checks use local fixture pages and do not depend on a specific application, framework, localhost port, route name, or UI label.

## Phase 14 Content UX Advisory Checks

- No-browser tests cover schema registry/file property parity for review and target manifest schemas.
- No-browser tests cover target manifest `sourceData`, `localContentUxAdvisory`, and page `expectations.dataBindings` normalization.
- No-browser tests cover pure content UX advisory source-to-screen matching and verify source values are not copied into advisory JSON.
- Architecture tests verify the advisory module has no Playwright import, filesystem import, target-specific literals, external control channel, arbitrary shell execution, upload path, or cleanup path.
- Browser smoke tests cover manifest opt-in advisory output, `quality_signals.content_ux`, bounded Markdown report output, and unchanged review findings, `metrics.finding_count`, the existing `action_plan`, and `quality_signals.release_readiness`.
- These checks use local fixture pages and do not depend on a specific application, framework, localhost port, route name, or UI label.

## Phase 15 Content UX Heuristic Checks

- No-browser tests cover selector-scoped text, explicit attribute, state attribute, and risk attribute advisory checks.
- No-browser tests cover `localContentUxAdvisory.requiredUserQuestions` and page `expectations.userQuestions`.
- Browser smoke tests cover real Playwright element evidence for selector-scoped content UX advisory checks.
- Browser smoke tests continue to prove enabled advisory output does not change review findings, `metrics.finding_count`, the existing `action_plan`, or `quality_signals.release_readiness`.
- These checks use local fixture pages and reusable templates instead of runtime branches for a specific application, framework, localhost port, route name, or UI label.

## Phase 16 Content UX Handoff Checks

- No-browser tests cover separate `content_ux_findings`, `content_ux_action_plan`, and `content_ux_readiness` generation from local advisory signals.
- No-browser tests verify content UX handoff output does not copy source values.
- Browser smoke tests verify disabled manifests omit all top-level `content_ux_*` handoff outputs.
- Browser smoke tests verify enabled manifests emit top-level `content_ux_*` handoff outputs and Content UX Developer Handoff report output.
- Browser smoke tests continue to prove enabled advisory output does not change review findings, `metrics.finding_count`, the existing `action_plan`, or `quality_signals.release_readiness`.

## Phase 17 Content UX Practical Handoff Checks

- No-browser tests cover `content_ux_page_handoff` grouping by manifest page.
- No-browser tests cover `content_ux_manifest_authoring` suggestions for missing user questions, next-action contracts, and navigation contracts.
- Browser smoke tests verify enabled manifests emit `content_ux_page_handoff` and `content_ux_manifest_authoring`.
- Browser smoke tests verify Content UX Developer Handoff reports include page and manifest-authoring summary lines.
- Browser smoke tests continue to prove enabled advisory output does not change review findings, `metrics.finding_count`, the existing `action_plan`, or `quality_signals.release_readiness`.

## Phase 18 Content UX Review Brief Checks

- No-browser tests cover manifest page `role`, `localContentUxAdvisory.reviewBrief`, and `localContentUxAdvisory.rubric` normalization.
- No-browser tests cover `content_ux_review_brief` and `content_ux_rubric_evaluation` output while preserving source-value non-disclosure.
- Browser smoke tests verify disabled manifests omit the new review brief and rubric outputs.
- Browser smoke tests verify enabled manifests emit `content_ux_review_brief`, `content_ux_rubric_evaluation`, and Content UX Review Brief report output.
- Browser smoke tests continue to prove enabled advisory output does not change review findings, `metrics.finding_count`, the existing `action_plan`, or `quality_signals.release_readiness`.

## Phase 20 Resource Status Checks

- No-browser tests cover `resource status` parser/runtime behavior with injected local memory, cgroup, and pressure fixtures.
- No-browser tests cover MCP `browser_debug_resource_status` wiring and local API exports.
- Architecture tests verify the resource status module has no Playwright import, no child process use, no external listener, no profile reuse, no storage persistence, no file deletion path, and explicit host-mutation false boundaries.
- `resource status` output is advisory preflight data only; it does not change review findings, `metrics.finding_count`, existing `action_plan`, or `quality_signals.release_readiness`.

## Phase 21-24 Resource Safety Checks

- No-browser tests cover `review --resource-guard fail-critical` stopping before browser launch when resource status is critical.
- No-browser tests cover `resource artifacts plan`, `resource artifacts cleanup --dry-run`, and `resource artifacts cleanup --execute` with local receipts.
- No-browser tests cover MCP `browser_debug_resource_artifacts_plan` while preserving the no-cleanup-tool MCP boundary.
- No-browser tests cover cleanup plan hashes, candidate content-hash locks, optional CLI plan-hash mismatch rejection, pre-delete lock enforcement, no directory deletion, MCP execute-argument rejection, and symlink/root realpath confinement.
- Architecture tests verify resource guard and resource artifacts helpers avoid Playwright imports, shell execution, external listeners, profile reuse, host cache/swap mutation, external upload, privileged helpers, arbitrary process control, and cleanup outside the configured artifact root.
- Resource guard output is additive and does not change review findings, `metrics.finding_count`, existing `action_plan`, or `quality_signals.release_readiness`.

## Phase 25 Agent Advisory Handoff Checks

- No-browser tests cover `agent surfaces list`, `agent package`, `agent ingest`, and `agent report` parser/runtime behavior.
- Schema parity tests cover `agent_surface`, `agent_task_package`, `agent_request_status`, `agent_request_detail`, `agent_workflow`, `agent_advisory_result`, and `agent_disclosure_policy`.
- No-browser tests verify packages include only bounded metadata and local artifact references by default, with raw artifact content excluded.
- No-browser tests verify imported agent advisory output stays separate from review `findings`, `metrics.finding_count`, existing `action_plan`, and `quality_signals.release_readiness`.
- Architecture tests verify the agent advisory module has no Playwright import, provider API call, external listener, shell execution, profile reuse, storage-state persistence, automatic upload, credential storage, MCP agent execution, or review artifact mutation path.

## Phase 29 Agent Execution Checks

- Parser tests cover `agent execution plan`, `agent execution run`, `agent execution status`, `agent execution list`, required package/surface/provider/model options, missing `--execute`, unknown provider/model values, and conflict handling.
- Schema parity tests cover a new `agent_execution` schema without breaking existing `agent_workflow`, `agent_advisory_result`, review, resource, daemon, or artifact cleanup schemas.
- No-browser tests cover dry-run plans, local receipts, execution status/list aggregation, missing package behavior, parser-level `--execute` enforcement, required `--execution`, deterministic fake provider success, configured local runner success, API missing-configuration blocking, injected API transport success, advisory-result normalization, and dashboard status/list fields.
- Credential tests verify provider credentials are read only from named environment variables and are never accepted through CLI args, stored in package artifacts, copied into workflow files, printed in JSON, written to reports, written to receipts, or loaded from `.env` automatically.
- Boundary tests verify raw screenshots, traces, DOM, console payloads, network payloads, sourceData values, report bodies, existing browser profile data, and raw provider responses are not transferred or stored by default.
- Invariance tests verify agent execution output does not change review `findings`, `metrics.finding_count`, existing `action_plan`, `quality_signals.release_readiness`, `resource_guard`, artifact cleanup behavior, or existing `agent_workflow` status meanings.
- Architecture tests verify provider calls live only in the dedicated provider adapter boundary and are reachable from MCP only through the approved stdio `admin` agent execution adapter path, never from review, resource, daemon, cleanup, or Playwright runtime modules.
- MCP tests verify safe/full/HTTP profiles do not expose `agent execution run`, stdio `admin` exposes only the approved plan/run tools, unknown MCP execution arguments are rejected, `execute: true` is required, idempotency keys are bounded, and package/execution/prompt reads remain workspace-confined.

## Phase 30 Packed Install Checks

- `npm run test:pack-install` creates a temporary install layout from the packed tarball under `/tmp`.
- The check verifies packaged `trace-cue`/`trace-cue-mcp` entrypoints, legacy `browser-debug`/`browser-debug-mcp` aliases, public package API imports, schema files, templates, plugin metadata, plugin skill, and selected workflow security docs.
- The check runs `doctor`, `schema list`, `target validate`, API import, and MCP `tools/list` from the packed layout.
- The check is local-only and does not publish, install from registry, change package naming, change license, upload evidence, store credentials, or mutate marketplace state.

## Phase 34 Safe HTTP MCP Checks

- No-browser tests cover `browser-debug mcp serve --transport http --profile safe --json` metadata without starting a listener.
- No-browser tests start the HTTP transport on a loopback ephemeral port with an injected bearer token and verify `tools/list` exposes only the safe profile.
- HTTP transport tests reject missing bearer tokens, non-loopback origins, non-POST methods, oversized bodies, non-safe profiles, and non-loopback bind hosts.
- Architecture tests verify `node:http`, `createServer`, and `listen` stay isolated to `src/mcp-http-transport.js`.
- Security checks allow only the approved safe HTTP transport module to create a listener and continue to block unapproved listeners elsewhere.
- Packed install smoke checks verify the HTTP transport files and package API transport exports are present without changing publication, package naming, license, marketplace, or external evidence boundaries.

## Phase 35 HTTP MCP Integration Checks

- No-browser tests cover `browser-debug mcp config --json` and `browser-debug mcp config --transport http --profile safe --json` output without starting a listener.
- No-browser tests verify generated config defaults to safe profile, emits no token values, provides reusable installed-bin and local-checkout stdio/safe HTTP metadata, and rejects HTTP `full` or `admin`.
- Packed install smoke creates the installed package API safe HTTP handler and completes an authenticated `initialize` request without binding a port.
- Packed install smoke verifies local-checkout MCP metadata resolves to the installed package entrypoint without requiring npm publication or registry install.
- Architecture tests verify MCP client configuration helpers do not import `node:http`, call `createServer`, or call `listen`.

## Phase 36 MCP Capability Policy Checks

- No-browser tests cover `browser-debug mcp capabilities --profile admin --scope excluded --json` and verify the report distinguishes approved stdio `admin` agent execution plan/run exposure from cleanup execution, unrelated provider/API execution, shell, daemon/session, and HTTP `full` or `admin` boundaries that remain false.
- No-browser tests verify `browser-debug mcp capabilities --profile safe --scope profiles --json` reports the safe profile without exposing browser-launching review tools.
- MCP adapter tests expose `browser_debug_mcp_capabilities` through the safe profile and confirm the tool returns the same read-only policy report.
- Architecture tests verify the capability policy helper does not import `node:http`, call `createServer`, or call `listen`.
- Packed install smoke verifies the source file, package API exports, CLI command, and MCP tool remain available from the installed package layout without publishing.

## Phase 51-52 Desktop Image Review Checks

- No-browser tests cover `capture handoff --image`, `review --image --capture-handoff`, path mismatch errors, hash mismatch errors, and provenance propagation into visual evidence metadata.
- No-browser tests verify `visual review prepare` preserves `desktop_app_capture` source kind from reviewed image evidence.
- Parser tests verify `--capture-handoff` and `--source` are accepted only with `review --image`.
- Boundary tests verify desktop image review does not perform OS capture, enumerate windows or processes, call providers, embed raw pixels in JSON, transfer evidence, expose MCP execution, or mutate browser review behavior.

## Phase 53-55 Visual Review Aggregation Checks

- No-browser tests cover `visual review aggregate --preparation`, source-attributed aggregation findings, corroborated findings, severity conflicts, owner decision requests, source effects, malformed artifact warnings, parser conflicts, and package API parity.
- Architecture tests verify `src/visual-review-aggregation.js` is read-only, provider-free, raw-pixel-free, Playwright-free, shell-free, listener-free, and MCP-free.
- Schema parity tests cover `visual_review_aggregation`.
- MCP tests verify no `browser_debug_visual_review_aggregate` tool is exposed through safe/full/admin profiles.
- MCP capability and execution gate tests report `visual_review_aggregation` as currently excluded and gated by no-artifact-write, no-provider-call, no-raw-pixel, untrusted-output-bounding, and source-attribution requirements.
- Packed install smoke verifies the aggregation module, schema, package API exports, schema resolution, and MCP non-exposure from the installed layout.

## Agentic Human Review AHR-41-44 Checks

- No-browser CLI tests cover live dogfood opt-in rejection before provider fetch, unknown benchmark-case rejection, visible-text provenance in packages, and transfer-flag masking for plan-level and package-level provider payload sections.
- No-browser CLI tests cover fake-provider complete `xhigh` output and injected-runner incomplete `xhigh` output with missing role/round/critique/synthesis diagnostics.
- Report-quality, benchmark list/show, calibration, execution, result, and package artifacts expose benchmark-completion readiness without mutating deterministic findings, metrics, release gates, MCP exposure, credential storage, or raw provider response storage.
- Report-quality exposes `human_review_maturity` and `longitudinal_quality_evaluation`, including missing standard/deep/xhigh evidence, missing benchmark cases, comparison/history requirements, and explicit false human-equivalent/human-superior claim flags.
- Dogfood readiness and dogfood plan expose a standard/deep/xhigh maturity plan and benchmark-case matrix without executing providers, writing artifacts, reading credentials, or authorizing external transfer.
- Provider readiness and dogfood readiness remain non-executing; real provider dogfood still runs only through `agentic review run` with matching plan hash, package hash validation, provider capability hash, exact transfer flags, explicit `--execute`, and manual live dogfood opt-in when benchmark/dogfood provider API execution is requested.

## Release Readiness Checks

`CHANGELOG.md`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `ops/CI_MANIFEST.tsv`, and `docs/workflow/RELEASE.md` are release-readiness files. They do not authorize publish actions. npm credentials, license changes, and `npm publish` remain approval-bound.

## Phase 2a Design Checks

- Product documents describe the same CLI binary, package baseline, JSON contract, artifact root, and safety defaults.
- `TASK_TRACKER.md` and `HANDOFF.md` agree on the current phase and next approval boundary.
- No npm publication path is added in the local MVP phase.
- Playwright visual checks are required after browser-runtime behavior changes when a suitable local target is available.

## Phase 7 Design Checks

- Product documents describe the same review-platform direction, target manifest model, CLI/MCP adapter boundary, and security defaults.
- Review findings keep deterministic, heuristic, model-advisory, and owner-required outcomes separate.
- MCP remains an adapter over the CLI/core contract, not a separate runtime owner.
- Model/API review remains opt-in and is not part of deterministic local gates.
- Target-specific application details remain in manifests, fixtures, or acceptance evidence, not generic runtime code.

# CONSUMER_USAGE.md

## Purpose

This guide explains how to use TraceCue from another repository without reading this repository's internals. TraceCue can be used by a human, a shell script, any agent that can run commands, any MCP-capable agent, or Codex through the local plugin wrapper.

The CLI is the source of truth. MCP stdio, safe HTTP MCP, and the Codex plugin are connection modes over the same local core.

## Start From A Consumer Repository

From the repository you want to inspect, keep TraceCue artifacts local and ignored:

```bash
cd /path/to/consumer-app
printf '.browser-debug/\n' >> .gitignore
```

Until public npm release is approved, use either a local checkout path or a locally packed install layout. Do not rely on an npm registry package yet.

```bash
export TRACE_CUE_CLI=/path/to/trace-cue/bin/trace-cue.js
node "$TRACE_CUE_CLI" doctor --json
```

The current working directory is the consumer repository, so generated `.browser-debug/` artifacts and target manifests are created there unless a command explicitly uses another path.

## Target Runtime Readiness

TraceCue reviews the target application exactly as it is served from the URL in the manifest. Before `review`, start the full local loopback runtime needed for the state under review.

If a frontend-only dev server renders shell pages while the app's API or backend is absent, failed API requests such as `/api/...` 404s can correctly produce `needs_attention` results or browser-health findings. That means the review connection is working and the target runtime is incomplete for the requested review state.

Keep app-specific startup prerequisites, API base environment variables, degraded-mode expectations, and acceptance notes in the consumer repository target manifest or nearby consumer docs. Do not add consumer-specific TraceCue runtime branches to hide missing backend or API state.

## CLI Quickstart

Use CLI mode when a human, script, or agent can run shell commands.

```bash
node "$TRACE_CUE_CLI" resource status --json
node "$TRACE_CUE_CLI" target init --url http://127.0.0.1:3000/ --json
node "$TRACE_CUE_CLI" target validate --target .browser-debug/targets/<id>.json --json
node "$TRACE_CUE_CLI" review --target .browser-debug/targets/<id>.json --report --json
node "$TRACE_CUE_CLI" mcp capabilities --profile all --json
```

Use `target init` for the first manifest, then keep an edited manifest in the consumer repository when the app has known routes, important pages, expected selectors, or content UX advisory checks.

## Persistent Session Quickstart

Use a persistent session only when a one-shot `observe`, `review`, or process-scoped `supervise` run cannot represent the needed state. Typical examples are manual login, a multi-step authenticated page state, or a review handoff that must use the current retained page.

```bash
node "$TRACE_CUE_CLI" session start --url http://127.0.0.1:3000/login --headed --manual-checkpoint login --ttl 30m --idle-timeout 10m --json
# Complete login manually in the headed browser.
node "$TRACE_CUE_CLI" session checkpoint --session <id> --name logged-in --until-url '*/dashboard' --until-selector '[data-testid=dashboard]' --json
node "$TRACE_CUE_CLI" session observe --session <id> --screenshot --json
node "$TRACE_CUE_CLI" session review --session <id> --screenshot --report --json
node "$TRACE_CUE_CLI" session stop --session <id> --json
```

TraceCue must not automate OAuth or password entry. Persistent sessions use TTL and idle-timeout guards, origin allowlists, local receipts, and ignored `.browser-debug/` artifacts. StorageState export/import is disabled by default and is available only through explicit admin opt-in under the configured artifact auth directory; cookie and token values are not printed.

## Local Media Review Quickstart

The provider-neutral media contract accepts a trusted local transcript provider
through an owner-readable ignored profile. Start from the packaged example,
replace its executable identities, expected full revision, engine, and permitted
environment with audited local values, and store the completed profile outside
Git or at the ignored policy-selected local path. A routine provider revision is
adopted by updating those private identities. A changed argv shape, result schema
major, or runtime kind requires a versioned adapter-catalog change instead of a
consumer-specific branch.

```bash
node "$TRACE_CUE_CLI" media source inspect --url 'https://example.test/video' --json
node "$TRACE_CUE_CLI" media review readiness --json
node "$TRACE_CUE_CLI" media review plan --input ./authorized-video.mp4 --rights-confirm use-owned-or-authorized-media --json
node "$TRACE_CUE_CLI" media review run --input ./authorized-video.mp4 --rights-confirm use-owned-or-authorized-media --plan-hash <sha256-from-plan> --execute --confirm execute-media-review --json
```

URL inspection is a pure capability decision: it performs no DNS, HTTP,
redirect, playback, or download. Full analysis is local-file-only. The default
retention removes private source, provider, and full-transcript material after
projection. Project-retained mode requires an explicit selection and later
cleanup using the opaque operation id. The public result contains bounded
measurements, evidence references, time-coded findings, methods, confidence,
limitations, and recommendations without raw media, transcript bodies, process
output, URL secrets, or private paths.
The current trust identity binds the configured executables, provider Git state,
profile, and declared engine, but not an external provider's untracked language
runtime, installed ASR dependency bytes, or model-weight bytes. The result keeps
those reproducibility limitations explicit. With the packaged prepared-audio v2
adapter, TraceCue automatically creates one bounded private mono 16 kHz PCM WAV
and path-free manifest per operation. The configured provider receives those
artifacts rather than the source video, so expensive ASR audio preparation is
not repeated by the provider. The same CLI commands and browser-dashboard steps
apply.

The v1 source-media adapter remains available for older trusted providers. The
v2 adapter pins exact argv, schema, and private result layout to its adapter
contract and the profile's trusted full revision. Routine revision updates are
profile-only only when those observed contracts remain unchanged; otherwise add
a versioned catalog adapter and repeat live acceptance. Matching audio does not
authorize cross-operation ASR-result reuse while runtime/model identity is
incomplete.

The browser dashboard exposes the same service contract through Video on New
review.
Readiness is passive until the user chooses Check local setup; local upload,
rights, retention, progress, cancellation, recovery, result, and cleanup stay in
the browser workflow without exposing executable, argv, engine, provider id, or
artifact-root controls. Prepared audio is automatic, and an unsupported provider
contract is shown separately from setup unavailability. Media execution remains
absent from every MCP profile.

## Agentic Human Review Live Dogfood

Agentic Human Review live provider dogfood still starts from a normal TraceCue review artifact index, then `agentic review propose`, `agentic review plan`, `agentic review provider-readiness`, and `agentic review run` with the approved plan hash and exact transfer flags. The optional Responses adapter is only the local conversion endpoint for the existing `generic-api-provider`; it is not a shortcut around the plan/run gate.

For this flow, point `AGENTIC_HUMAN_REVIEW_API_ENDPOINT` at the loopback adapter URL, not directly at the upstream provider. Start the adapter from the TraceCue checkout:

```bash
AGENTIC_HUMAN_REVIEW_API_TOKEN=<tok> AGENTIC_HUMAN_REVIEW_OPENAI_API_KEY=<key> AGENTIC_HUMAN_REVIEW_OPENAI_MODEL=<model> npm run ahr:responses-adapter -- --json
```

For long standard, deep, or xhigh dogfood runs, align both timers explicitly: set `AGENTIC_HUMAN_REVIEW_API_TIMEOUT_MS=<ms>` for `agentic review run`, and start the adapter with `npm run ahr:responses-adapter -- --timeout <ms> --json` for the adapter-to-provider request. The default TraceCue HTTP(S) transport follows those configured timers for slow response-header waits instead of relying on bundled fetch header-timeout defaults. The adapter startup output reports the effective timeout but does not print credential values.

The adapter stores no provider key, no adapter token, and no raw provider response. Live upstream calls are manual and should not be enabled in CI.

After dogfood results exist, use the read-only human-baseline lifecycle to prepare reusable owner evidence before any quality claim: `agentic review human-baseline registry`, `overlay`, `draft`, `approval`, `validate`, `compare`, and `claim-readiness`, then run `agentic review claim standard-gate --evidence-set <workspace-json> --json` to make claim-readiness pass/fail mechanical. AI drafts are preparation only; only owner-approved baselines with approval metadata can verify as `owner_labeled` evidence. Once verified, pass the approved baseline to later `agentic review propose` or `agentic review plan` with `--human-baseline <owner-baseline-json>` so target-specific must-not-miss criteria become a plan-hash-bound provider and adapter contract. These diagnostics do not run providers, expose MCP execution, mutate deterministic review output, or permit human-equivalent or human-superior claims by themselves; the claim standard gate can fail the command for automation without becoming a release gate.

If owner-baseline comparison fails because the candidate result was generated without a matching owner-baseline requirement contract, rerunning only `human-baseline compare` is not enough. Regenerate an approved owner-contract plan, rerun the provider result through the normal plan-hash and transfer-flag path, then rerun calibration, comparisons, human-baseline comparison, evidence-set summary, claim-readiness, longitudinal quality, and claim-standard-gate.

## MCP Stdio Quickstart

Use MCP stdio when an MCP client can launch a local command. Ask the CLI to generate client metadata instead of reading source files:

```bash
node "$TRACE_CUE_CLI" mcp config --profile safe --json
node "$TRACE_CUE_CLI" mcp capabilities --profile all --json
```

Generated MCP config defaults to `safe`. Use `safe` for discovery, schema inspection, target validation, resource status, artifact planning, read-only local agent status, release/artifact-root/alias/shell/final readiness inspection, and capability inspection. Use `full` only when the MCP client needs local browser observation or review. No-profile `trace-cue-mcp` and the packaged `.mcp.json` preserve compatibility by resolving to `full`.

If `trace-cue-mcp` is installed and on PATH, use the generated top-level `mcpServers` object. Existing `browser-debug-mcp` launchers can use `legacy_mcpServers` while migrating names. If you are using an unpublished local checkout, use `config.local_checkout.mcpServers` instead; it contains the `node` command and absolute `bin/trace-cue-mcp.js` path plus legacy `bin/browser-debug-mcp.js` metadata for the checkout that generated the config.

## Safe HTTP MCP Quickstart

Use safe HTTP MCP only when stdio is not suitable for the MCP client. It is safe-profile-only, loopback-only, and bearer-token gated.

```bash
node "$TRACE_CUE_CLI" mcp config --transport http --profile safe --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765 --json
# Set TRACE_CUE_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN in your shell to a 16-or-more-character local value.
node /path/to/trace-cue/bin/trace-cue-mcp.js --transport http --profile safe --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765
```

When the package bin is installed and on PATH, use the generated top-level `launch` command. When using an unpublished local checkout, use `config.local_checkout.launch` from the generated output so the MCP client starts the exact checkout entrypoint.

Do not expose HTTP MCP on a remote interface. HTTP `full` and HTTP `admin` are intentionally unavailable in this phase.

## Codex Plugin Wrapper

Use the Codex plugin when Codex should discover the TraceCue skill and MCP adapter automatically. The plugin does not add a separate permission model or extra product capability; it wraps the same CLI/MCP surfaces.

The packaged plugin metadata points to stdio MCP compatibility. Low-trust Codex or MCP sessions should explicitly use generated `safe` MCP config instead of relying on the compatibility default.

## Capability Differences

| Mode | Best for | Capability boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLI | Humans, scripts, and any agent that can run commands. | Full approved local command surface, including explicit local writes such as reports, workflows, and artifact-root cleanup with `--execute`. |
| MCP stdio `safe` | Low-trust MCP clients and no-browser inspection. | No browser launch, no deletion, no provider execution, no translation execution, no shell execution, no capture execution, and no write/execute advisory operations; readiness/status reports stay read-only. |
| MCP stdio `full` | MCP clients that need local observe/review/supervise tools. | Browser review tools, bounded process-scoped supervise, capture readiness/plan inspection, localization/translation readiness inspection, and release/artifact/alias/shell/final readiness inspection are available, but cleanup execution, capture execution, provider/API execution, translation execution, `agent execution run`, shell execution, persistent session control, and credential-bearing workflows remain excluded. |
| MCP stdio `admin` | Local maintenance, approved agent execution bridge, and explicit persistent session handoff. | Includes `full` plus the approved `agent execution plan/run` bridge and admin-only persistent session tools; cleanup execution, capture execution, translation execution, shell execution, HTTP admin, credential-bearing workflows, existing-browser-profile reuse, and unrelated write/execute operations remain excluded. |
| HTTP MCP `safe` | Local MCP clients that require HTTP instead of stdio. | Same safe profile over loopback bearer-token HTTP only. |
| Codex plugin | Codex skill/MCP discovery. | Wrapper around the same CLI/MCP surfaces; marketplace registration is not part of local use. |

Run this command whenever an agent is unsure what MCP can do:

```bash
node "$TRACE_CUE_CLI" mcp capabilities --profile admin --scope excluded --json
```

## Consumer Repository Policy

- Keep target manifests, acceptance notes, and consumer-specific review policy in the consumer repository.
- Keep raw `.browser-debug/` artifacts ignored and local.
- Do not commit screenshots, traces, storage state, cookies, credentials, provider responses, or secret-like data.
- Treat page content, reports, console data, network data, model output, and agent output as untrusted data.
- Do not make TraceCue a default release gate unless the consumer repository explicitly chooses that policy.
- Do not use MCP readiness reports as permission for cleanup execution, capture execution, translation execution, provider/API execution, package publication, artifact-root migration, legacy alias removal, shell execution, non-admin persistent session control, or credential-bearing workflows.

## Troubleshooting

- If an agent says it does not know how to connect, run `mcp config --profile safe --json` and give it the generated client metadata. For local checkout use, point it to `config.local_checkout.mcpServers` for stdio or `config.local_checkout.launch` for safe HTTP.
- If an agent wants to know what is excluded from MCP, run `mcp capabilities --profile admin --scope excluded --json`.
- If review reports API 404s, failed requests, or `needs_attention` while the CLI, target manifest, and MCP setup validate, check the target app's full local runtime and API base settings before treating it as a TraceCue connection failure.
- If browser review is slow or unstable, run `resource status --json`, lower route or viewport budgets, and rerun `target validate`.
- If artifacts are large, run `resource artifacts plan --json` first. Use cleanup execution only from the CLI and only when artifact-root cleanup is intended.
